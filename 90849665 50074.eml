                Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs
        programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in
        Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank’s
        high-frequency trading platform. <br>
                He was convicted on two counts theft of trade secrets
        and transportation of stolen property and faces up to 10 years
        in prison. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the
        courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman’s
        proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the
        firm’s high-frequency trading business, including that the unit
        accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than
        1 percent of Goldman’s total revenue of $45 billion. <br>
        <br>
        On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal
        Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark
        International airport and arrested him. <br>
        <br>
        Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual
        United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him
        under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his
        sentencing, which is set for March 18. <br>
