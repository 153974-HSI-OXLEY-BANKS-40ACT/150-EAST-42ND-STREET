Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, incl=
uding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm B=
alanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (=
four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collect=
ively referred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of September 30, 2021,=
 the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 throu=
gh September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements =
of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September =
30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 202=
0, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of th=
e periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinan=
cial statements=E2=80=9D). In our opinion, the financial statements present=
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Fu=
nds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for t=
he period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended No=
vember 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period Dec=
ember 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in t=
he period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for =
each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting princip=
les generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds=E2=80=99 man=
agement.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 financial=
 statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounti=
ng Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independe=
nt with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities=
 laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with th=
e standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform =
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem=
ents are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.   =
=20
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material m=
isstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and=
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include=
d examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosure=
s in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the acco=
unting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wel=
l as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our p=
rocedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 202=
1 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not r=
eceived from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe th=
at our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, incl=
uding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm B=
alanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (=
four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collect=
ively referred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of September 30, 2021,=
 the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 throu=
gh September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements =
of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September =
30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 202=
0, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of th=
e periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinan=
cial statements=E2=80=9D). In our opinion, the financial statements present=
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Fu=
nds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for t=
he period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended No=
vember 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period Dec=
ember 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in t=
he period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for =
each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting princip=
les generally accepted in the United States of America.

agement.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 financial=
 statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounti=
ng Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independe=
nt with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities=
 laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with th=
e standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform =
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem=
ents are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.   =
=20
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material m=
isstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and=
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include=
d examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosure=
s in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the acco=
unting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wel=
l as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our p=
rocedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 202=
1 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not r=
eceived from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe th=
at our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, incl=
uding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm B=
alanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (=
four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collect=
ively referred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of September 30, 2021,=
 the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 throu=
gh September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements =
of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September =
30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 202=
0, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of th=
e periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinan=
cial statements=E2=80=9D). In our opinion, the financial statements present=
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Fu=
nds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for t=
he period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended No=
vember 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period Dec=
ember 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in t=
he period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for =
each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting princip=
les generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds=E2=80=99 man=
agement.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 financial=
 statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounti=
ng Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independe=
nt with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities=
 laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with th=
e standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform =
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem=
ents are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.   =
=20
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material m=
isstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and=
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include=
d examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosure=
s in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the acco=
unting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wel=
l as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our p=
rocedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 202=
1 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not r=
eceived from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe th=
at our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in Ad=
visers Investment Trust since 2011.

Hey Josephine good evening,

I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Gorman received NOTICE earlier, and so =
I filed these two CRD reports to make sure that her was alerted to this eff=
ect. I later sent it to institutional sales that I found on the Bloomberg T=
erminal, also to the attorneys as referenced below in a Material Filing whi=
ch carries several problems as referenced in the language of the EX-99.CERT=
 and EX-99.906CERT.

BELOW MY SIGNATURE ARE THE DOCUMENTS I USED TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS MADE AWAR=
E OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND TO AVOID ANY FURTHER LOSSES.

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, incl=
uding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm B=
alanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (=
four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collect=
ively referred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of September 30, 2021,=
 the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 throu=
gh September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements =
of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September =
30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 202=
0, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of th=
e periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinan=
cial statements=E2=80=9D). In our opinion, the financial statements present=
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Fu=
nds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for t=
he period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended No=
vember 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period Dec=
ember 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in t=
he period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for =
each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting princip=
les generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds=E2=80=99 man=
agement.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 financial=
 statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounti=
ng Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independe=
nt with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities=
 laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with th=
e standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform =
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem=
ents are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.   =
=20
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material m=
isstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and=
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include=
d examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosure=
s in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the acco=
unting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wel=
l as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our p=
rocedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 202=
1 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not r=
eceived from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe th=
at our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
