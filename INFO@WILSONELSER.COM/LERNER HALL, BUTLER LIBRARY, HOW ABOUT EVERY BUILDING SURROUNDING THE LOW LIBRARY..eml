I don't know, ask the parents what they feel about it, just make sure it 
is on the front page of the ADMISSIONS, or APPLICATION --

* for example - and LET me know how many students enroll.

when you use the keyword <locked> you are really bringing yourself 
beyond the area of CONTROLLED or CONTROVERSIAL RIGHTS and ACTIONS during 
the xmas ERA.


*just keep an eye on that. TY

YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO TREAT THEIR STUDENTS LIKE THAT?
- AS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION?

YOU CAN'T ALLOW THAT EITHER... IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE.
 >> THOSE CAMERAS --- ARE ALL MONITORED AND EVEN IN MY APARTMENT
- AS PROVIDED EARLIER, NEED TO RECORD MY CONVERSATIONS FOR SOMETHING YOU 
REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW ASHLEY.

 > WHICH IS WHY, I BEG YOU TO PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE, IN GOOD CANDOR - 
NOT LEGAL ADVICE, THAT'S LIFE.



THAT LINK - IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED EITHER---

 >> i left them out of this part in to TO area....
*LETS* see who I reported and IF/WHAT they tell you about THEIR INVOLVEMENTS

.... they are in FACT: PEEPING TOMS, WALKING FELONS WITHOUT A CHARGE, 
ARRAIGNMENT DATE, AND

*HINT: *I have no idea what backyard those servers may hold those videos 
either - PEEPING TOMCATS, ARE ABOVE YOU BEYOND WHERE THE EYE CAN SEE.
