         Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs 
programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of 
stealing proprietary source code from the bank’s high-frequency trading 
platform.
         He was convicted on two counts theft of trade secrets and 
transportation of stolen property and faces up to 10 years in prison.


During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to 
the public several times to protect Goldman’s proprietary source code. 
Yet several details emerged about the firm’s high-frequency trading 
business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in 
revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman’s total revenue of $45 
billion.

On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International 
airport and arrested him.

Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United 
States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home 
confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set 
for March 18.

A version of this article appears in print on Dec. 11, 2010, Section B, 
Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wall St. Programmer 
Guilty of Code Theft.

  United States Attorney Southern District of New York

  Manhattan U.S. Attorney PREET BHARARA said: "Protecting the 
proprietary information of America’s companies is critically important. 
Today’s sentence sends a clear message that professionals like Sergey 
Aleynikov who abuse their positions of trust to steal confidential 
business information from their employers will be prosecuted and punished."
