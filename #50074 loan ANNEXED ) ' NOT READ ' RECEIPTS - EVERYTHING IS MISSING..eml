LOAN #50074 loan ANNEXED >> maxient >> NOT REPORTED IN EDGAR


Thank you for looking into this.


*They also liked to monitor the interior of my apartment, as the saying 
goes...**
* **
*Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.*
- especially when they are on the hook for billions in damages, and a 
certain Violation of Privacy Tort which guarantees the benefit *OF* a 
Prison Sentence.

Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United 
States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home 
confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set 
for March 18. A version of this article appears in print on Dec. 11, 
2010, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wall 
St. Programmer Guilty of Code Theft.” (Lattman) In that case of a breach 
of conduct, the FBI on behalf of Goldman Sachs followed this programmer 
to the other side of the world, and only to greet him upon his return to 
America – despite his double standard of life and “stoic” presence in 
the courtroom, found his way to Prison.

*Step 2: United States Attorney Southern District of New York*

Manhattan U.S. Attorney PREET BHARARA said: "Protecting the proprietary 
information of America’s companies is critically important. Today’s 
sentence sends a clear message that professionals like Sergey Aleynikov 
who abuse their positions of trust to steal confidential business 
information from their employers will be prosecuted and punished.” 
(United States Attorney Southern District of New York)

i.A TOTAL OF 8-YEARS SENTENCED ON MARCH 18, 2011 just about 6 months 
later for precedent, not by the President.

Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United 
States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home 
confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set 
for March 18. A version of this article appears in print on Dec. 11, 
2010, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wall 
St. Programmer Guilty of Code Theft.” (Lattman) In that case of a breach 
of conduct, the FBI on behalf of Goldman Sachs followed this programmer 
to the other side of the world, and only to greet him upon his return to 
America – despite his double standard of life and “stoic” presence in 
the courtroom, found his way to Prison.

*Step 2: United States Attorney Southern District of New York*

Manhattan U.S. Attorney PREET BHARARA said: "Protecting the proprietary 
information of America’s companies is critically important. Today’s 
sentence sends a clear message that professionals like Sergey Aleynikov 
who abuse their positions of trust to steal confidential business 
information from their employers will be prosecuted and punished.” 
(United States Attorney Southern District of New York)

i.A TOTAL OF 8-YEARS SENTENCED ON MARCH 18, 2011 just about 6 months 
later for precedent, not by the President.
(United States Attorney *Southern District of New York*)*
