Gov. Hochul,

**** THIS WILL WORK ****

*-- I took the Wilson and Dicker firm off the email thread. and only 
left the Zuckers and counselors of Columbia that they spoke with during 
the proceedings in NYSCEF 153974/2020.*_*
*_

https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/law/downloads/pdf/Real%20Property%20Tax%20Audit%20Report%20Form%20(4-2013).pdf

/They don't need to share their results with me... their interests are 
all safe with you Gov. Hochul, and your third party review team (which 
should be two audit firms that are NOT affiliated) with any of these 
affairs/

/
/

/- try standard chartered and maybe another one, and then have them 
cross-reference with your Comptroller (who i met earlier by the way, not 
the new one though) the old guy at Bobby Vans./

I have no say in the TIME LIMIT to INDEPENDENTLY QUALIFY this as a 
proper way to identify variations observed in their assessments of VALUE 
in those property taxes for the 144 units and 6 respective buildings - 
filed and reported with the DFS to obtain a $6 million dollar loan from 
state farm... but/

I think ONE FORM for each unit is the best way AND NOT TO BE SADISTIC, 
HONESTLY/

/- but that way it's easier to analyze variations by unit and by each 
person.
- Especially since they already failed to even bring light to the fact 
that it is IMPOSSIBLE to have them qualified as "LAWFUL RENTAL 
PROPERTIES"  without a certificate of occupancy/

///--- if you don't do it that way... it will be difficult to find the 
criminals among the group of participants that circulated those 
un-consented videos of myself...
--- If you want to figure it out, those 144 reports will prove who/who 
did not participate in the violation of my privacy.//
/

If you do it one unit per form, they file 144 forms and unlawfully 
represent those interests 144 times...  they cannot argue any further 
that they made a fat finger mistake

- it will be very easy to understand who did and didn't understand what 
is going on, and who was and wasn't responsible for being an accessory 
to tax evasion as represented in the dockets in NYSCEF 153974/2020.

FOR A 24 hour WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY - just like that STFGX move on Dec 
22, 2021 --- If the onus was on me I would get it done like now.

*--- all I care about is the 144 units, and they should INDEPENDENTLY 
fill out the form to see if they are all in sync.  or if there a 
variation in the majority opinion...**

*plus, it's only 17 pages... per unit.

I understand... paperwork can be annoying sometimes, but if these Wilson 
& Elser lawyers and the others that represented the interests of the 
Sullivan Properties LP as directors take the time to each assess those 
properties, it will take much less time to figure out who is guilty and 
put a stop to any furtherance of these continuing crimes.


How long can it take for all of them to complete this in light of the 
damages registered and gross negligence of the carried interest over a 
period of 10 years that I know about. (5) This is required by police 
officers for each traffic violation or even for an expired registration, 
they can't just group up chevrolet violations as one ticket - its each 
license plate - so I mean it's only fair that they report it for each 
unit --- in case they make 144 mistakes in a row - you'll know they are 
guilty.

Without a CO they can't be qualified as buildings with X number of units 
as "rental units" that generate income... So for the 144 units, each 
having an address--- do you think their numbers will all match up - or 
differ based on opinion?

I just used the base cap rate, using the table of all owners to make my 
assessment

- the one I posted them with earlier...

#GOCARDS.

*//s/ BO DINCER./*

Hey if you want to get serious and have a REAL opinion... get serious 
and wake the heck up-- it's problem, not yours. - but give them a time 
limit on when to submit those forms, that's more money than they can all 
make COMBINED in a year in tax-evasion, it was up in the $500 million 
range in 2020, so...

as the fed-30 RATE MOVES HIGHER, THEY ACTUALLY GET TAXED MORE ON THE 
COMPOUND DAILY INTEREST FOR THE TWO YEARS OF AVOIDANCE AND IBSTRUCTION 
IN THE PRIOR...

---- plus they're going to have way more issues by the time I am done 
watching this movie here instead <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299117/>
