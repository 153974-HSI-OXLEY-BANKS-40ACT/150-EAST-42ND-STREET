the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets 
of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue 
the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both 
vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did 
represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as 
those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a 
bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

Hey it is Sunday, and as promised.
Ã¢Â?Â? that truth does hurt when the dust settles, I can hit three court 
houses in 30 States this quickly.

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York 
Ã¢Â?Â?ONLYÃ¢Â?ÂÃ¢Â?Â¦.
Ã¢Â?Â?- without feeling Ã¢Â?Â?that vibeÃ¢Â?Â of a different variety 
though, not Ã¢Â?Â?that vibeÃ¢Â?Â when the bad guys are after you, the 
other vibe..  But still a vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets 
faxed with the header.

           Ã¢Â?Â?CEASE AND DESISTÃ¢Â?Â

Ã¢Â?Â?CanÃ¢Â?Â?t find himÃ¢Â?Â¦ hahÃ¢Â?Â they eventually are going to 
want to sue someone or file with the SEC and give up another client for 
immediate Ã¢Â?Â?heightened supervisionÃ¢Â?Â upon filing.

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer 
though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promisedÃ¢Â?Â¦

Ã¢Â?Â? NEW YORK COUNTYÃ¢Â?Â? CLEARED.

Ã¢Â?Â? that truth hurts, doesnÃ¢Â?Â?t itÃ¢Â?Â¦ had to get my beauty rest 
IÃ¢Â?Â?m sorry, but look Nancy sunshine???!!!

Christmas came early for some, but if they sold it in the quarter prior 
while the price was higherÃ¢Â?Â¦ then for sure they are not going to 
talking to any regulatory choir.

Like as in, the JuryÃ¢Â?Â? I met Johnny, a loooooooomg time ago, and 
just enough time , as implied.

<br>

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do 
the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent 
sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about 
insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of 
current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as 
they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 
10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a 
natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My 
Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding 
unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have a certificate of occupancy.<br>


  Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security 
deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how 
many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, 
notwithstanding the legal matter <br>

Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual proceedings 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic decided to Violate my Privacy and my 
home, perverted and self-proclaimed landlords most likely have more 
items which need be reviewed in their thought process ( as in evaluated 
) to avoid "spillage" with the brains of general population, as I belive 
they are substandard, no matter how much money they have Ã¢Â?Â? 
combined. /s/ Bo Dincer.


  *Checking this box authorizes the FDIC to respond to your inquiry, no 
check box on the lease for the unlawful legal RECEIPTS which also may or 
may have been used in furtherance of the SEC filer, item 10 in Madoff, 
and USC 18.21 Violated as misrepresented to the public and used in 
conjunction with USC 18.225.

- see also: USC 18.2, USC 18.3, USC 18.4, and USC 26.X


Most respectfully,


/S/ BO DINCER.

P.S. stop spending all day evesdropping on emails, the students are 
there for a reason you idiots, go - do - something - else.


We.will track those as well.



- if you ask me, what was I doing while they were committing these 
felonies during the the Covid-19 pandemic, you'll have to reach out to 
the NSF as well, filed.

Farmers... how funny? Not for the farmers at 116th. guaranteed.


FACTS Ã¢Â?Â? plural.

Ã¢Â?Â? will also avoid prosecution at any cost.

Ã¢Â?Â? Another 14.1BLN at risk PrezBo, you canÃ¢Â?Â?t afford it..

Ã¢Â?Â? and IÃ¢Â?Â?ll prove it, itÃ¢Â?Â?s addressed property in the BCC., 
you bail them all out

18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged 
concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go 
about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of 
current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as 
they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 
10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a 
natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My 
Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding 
unlawful assets in custody

18Ã?Â§1963 ----<NYC DEPT OF FINANCE - PUBLIC

   (1) any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, 
altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and
   (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;
   -such element may be established by proof that the defendant, after 
or as a result of an official representation as to the nature of the 
property, believed the property to be embezzled, robbed, stolen, 
converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or 
obliterated.
</p>
USC 18

<p>
(a) Whoever-

during any 24-month period
-shall be fined not more than $10,000,000 if an individual, or 
$20,000,000 if an organization, and imprisoned for a term of not less

of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control

(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of 
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
</p>

Ã?Â§1963. Criminal penalties
<p>
(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the 
maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit 
to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law-
(1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of 
section 1962;
(2) any-
(A) interest in;
(B) security of;
(C) claim against; or

influence over;
any enterprise which the person has established, operated, controlled, 
conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 
1962; and
(3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the 
person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or 
unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962.
The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition 
to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who 
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-
(1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in 
land; and
(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, 
privileges, interests, claims, and securities.

### USC 18. Ã?Â§208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â?Â? 
fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the SecretaryÃ¢Â?Â?s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of 
this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not 
amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, 
such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment 
company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to 
said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with 
the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the 
instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, 
and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before 
assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or 
agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser 
of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall 
contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person 
against any liability to such company or its security holders to which 
he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by 
reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under 
such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

26 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
underpayments

Ã?Â§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and 
Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
(Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â or Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation 
misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth 
in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5).


(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent 
of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
6662(h)(2) and Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion 
of an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
misstatement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 
6664(a) and
Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A 
of the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), there 
is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in Ã?Â§ 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term Ã¢Â?Â?propertyÃ¢Â?Â refers to 
both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. Ã?Â§ 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92

Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of

15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â?Â? 
fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the SecretaryÃ¢Â?Â?s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of 
this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not 
amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, 
such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment 
company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to 
said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with 
the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the 
instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, 
and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before 
assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or 
agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser 
of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall 
contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person 
against any liability to such company or its security holders to which 
he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by 
reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under 
such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO YEARS 
SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
- TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS POINT)

SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE 
STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE 
FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT 
STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE 
ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES 
ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN 
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL - THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
 > THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

Ã?Â§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons

United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit,

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred

handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited

under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and
         (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

or obliterated.
             -(b) For purposes of this section, the term "official

United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures

     Ã?Â§3. - Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an offense 
against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, 
comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his 
apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.

                     (18) THE ZUCKER ORGANIZATION LLC
USC 18, Ã?Â§ 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage

                 (15)    <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

Ã?Â§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property
USC 18, Ã?Â§218. Voiding transactions in violation of chapter; recovery 
by the United States

agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

USC 18, Ã?Â§216. Penalties and injunctions

     (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.
         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the 
offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the 
amount set forth in this title, or both.
     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

     (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-
     -Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this 
title.
     (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-

official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the 
nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, 
application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, 
claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular 
matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives 
in advance a written determination made by such official that the 
interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the 
integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee;
         (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of 
Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal 
Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the requirements 
of subsection (a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect

which such regulation applies;
         (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an 
advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (including an individual being considered for an appointment to such 
a position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or
         (4) if the financial interest that would be affected by the 
particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of 
the officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in 
birthrights-
             (A) in an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized 
group or community, including any Alaska Native village corporation as 
defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs 
and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their 
status as Indians,
             (B) in an Indian allotment the title to which is held in 
trust by the United States or which is inalienable by the allottee 
without the consent of the United States, or

by the United States,

or claims fund or the Indian tribe, band, nation, organized group or 
community, or Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or 
parties.
     (c)(1) For the purpose of paragraph (1) of subsection (b), in the 
case of class A and B directors of Federal Reserve banks, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall be deemed to be the 
Government official responsible for appointment.
     (2) The potential availability of an exemption under any particular 
paragraph of subsection (b) does not preclude an exemption being granted 
pursuant to another paragraph of subsection (b).
     (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any determination granting an 
exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made available to 
the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978. In making such determination available, the agency may withhold 
from disclosure any information contained in the determination that 
would be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For 
purposes of determinations under subsection (b)(3), the information 
describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive than that 
required of the individual in his or her financial disclosure report 
under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
     (2) The Office of Government Ethics, after consultation with the 
Attorney General, shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of 
waivers and exemptions under subsection (b) which shall-
         (A) list and describe exemptions; and
         (B) provide guidance with respect to the types of interests 
that are not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the 
integrity of the services the Government may expect from the employee.

assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not

represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as 
those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a 
bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

  Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security 
deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how 
many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, 
notwithstanding the legal matter <br>

of NYSCEF 153974_2020.<br>

  --- SECURITY DEPOSIT(S) ARE HELD IN CUSTODY <br><br>
AT JP MORGAN CHASE BANK, N/A

             Confirm USC Title 18.4, 18.3. 18.3, and under USC 18.225 
violated and obstructed a federal investigation of a different variety 
by the counselors and accessories of 153974_2020 who obtained a loan 
forn$6 million from STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY and while on 
9/23/2020 obtained another 600 thousand due to their hardships avoided 
prosecution by keeping me pre-occupied and atill carrybthe interest and 
burdens transferred to State Farm in Loan 50074, accrued both unlawful 
and imaginary interest at both HSBC and JP Morgan Chase Bank which is 
used for overnight lending by and between all banks.

             Are those rent receipts matching up with the gross income 
(that is unlawful) matching the income reported to the NY dept of 
Finance as well?

             In that case also has represented their confessions UNDER 
USC 18.225 and USC 18.21 as well as other violations of Security Law, 
namely manipulation of ticker STFGX lost the bulk of its market 
capitalization on December 21,2021.

             Was this also a communal decision to mark its NAV at $106? 
Why not $107? Or $101? There is no material change in holdings reported 
for CIK filer 93715 or 1516523 as thisbwas obstructed by several 
accessories, counselors, and directors of Sullivan Properties LP.

             Continuing Financial Crimes, $20 million / corp, an $10 
million per inividual if you needed cause for obstruction oter than the 
minimum prison sentences implied.

             Enjoy that while you consider how quickly problems get 
resolved for the 55 in an overnight and with my intervention.

             Keep my family our of your affairs, and dont threaten them 
like the voicemail attached here carries a life and potential death 
sentence. Not sure if state farm will cover that as a provision of their 
terms of WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS who are still at risk while you 
play marco polo with the real statutues and laws. Which have statute of 
limitations.

             Voicemail threatening an imaginary case, property and 
deed,  confirmation of participation attached.

             Have a good evening Zucker.

the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets 
of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue 
the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both 
vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did 
represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as 
those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a 
bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

Hey it is Sunday, and as promised.
Ã¢Â?Â? that truth does hurt when the dust settles, I can hit three court 
houses in 30 States this quickly.

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York 
Ã¢Â?Â?ONLYÃ¢Â?ÂÃ¢Â?Â¦.
Ã¢Â?Â?- without feeling Ã¢Â?Â?that vibeÃ¢Â?Â of a different variety 
though, not Ã¢Â?Â?that vibeÃ¢Â?Â when the bad guys are after you, the 
other vibe..  But still a vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets 
faxed with the header.

           Ã¢Â?Â?CEASE AND DESISTÃ¢Â?Â

Ã¢Â?Â?CanÃ¢Â?Â?t find himÃ¢Â?Â¦ hahÃ¢Â?Â they eventually are going to 
want to sue someone or file with the SEC and give up another client for 
immediate Ã¢Â?Â?heightened supervisionÃ¢Â?Â upon filing.

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer 
though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promisedÃ¢Â?Â¦

Christmas came early for some, but if they sold it in the quarter prior

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do 
the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent 
sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about 
insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of 
current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as 
they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 
10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a 
natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My 
Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding 
unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>

Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual proceedings 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic decided to Violate my Privacy and my 
home, perverted and self-proclaimed landlords most likely have more 
items which need be reviewed in their thought process ( as in evaluated 
) to avoid "spillage" with the brains of general population, as I belive 
they are substandard, no matter how much money they have Ã¢Â?Â? 
combined. /s/ Bo Dincer.


  *Checking this box authorizes the FDIC to respond to your inquiry, no 
check box on the lease for the unlawful legal RECEIPTS which also may or 
may have been used in furtherance of the SEC filer, item 10 in Madoff,

obliterated.
</p>

commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of

(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of 
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
</p>

Ã?Â§1963. Criminal penalties
<p>
(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the 
maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit

to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who 
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-
(1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in

### USC 18. Ã?Â§208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. Ã?Â§ 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92

15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â?Â? 
fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the SecretaryÃ¢Â?Â?s determination.




https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id739ce.pdf
[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of 
this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not 
amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, 
such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment 
company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to 
said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with 
the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the 
instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, 
and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before 
assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or 
agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser 
of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall 
contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person 
against any liability to such company or its security holders to which 
he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by 
reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under 
such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

26 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
underpayments

Ã?Â§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and 
Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
(Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â or Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation 
misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth 
in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5).


(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent 
of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
6662(h)(2) and Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion 
of an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
misstatement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 
6664(a) and
Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A 
of the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), there 
is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in Ã?Â§ 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term Ã¢Â?Â?propertyÃ¢Â?Â refers to 
both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction

specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. Ã?Â§ 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92

15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â?Â? 
fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the SecretaryÃ¢Â?Â?s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of 
this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not 
amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, 
such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment 
company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to 
said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with 
the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the 
instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, 
and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before 
assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or 
agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser 
of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall 
contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person 
against any liability to such company or its security holders to which 
he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by 
reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under 
such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO YEARS 
SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
- TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS POINT)

SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE 
STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE 
FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT 
STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE 
ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES 
ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN 
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL - THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
 > THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

                     (18) THE ZUCKER ORGANIZATION LLC
USC 18, Ã?Â§ 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more

                 (15)    <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

Ã?Â§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property
USC 18, Ã?Â§218. Voiding transactions in violation of chapter; recovery 
by the United States

     In addition to any other remedies provided by law the President or, 
under regulations prescribed by him, the head of any department or 
agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

USC 18, Ã?Â§216. Penalties and injunctions

     (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.
         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the 
offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the 
amount set forth in this title, or both.
     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

                     (18) THE ZUCKER ORGANIZATION LLC
USC 18, Ã?Â§ 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more 
than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the 
crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by 
life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty 
years.

                 (15)    <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

Ã?Â§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property
USC 18, Ã?Â§218. Voiding transactions in violation of chapter; recovery 
by the United States

     In addition to any other remedies provided by law the President or, 
under regulations prescribed by him, the head of any department or 
agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

USC 18, Ã?Â§216. Penalties and injunctions

     (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.
         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the 
offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the 
amount set forth in this title, or both.
     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those 
assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not 
pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported 
both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did 
represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as 
those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a 
bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

  Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security 
deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how 
many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed,

             Confirm USC Title 18.4, 18.3. 18.3, and under USC 18.225 
violated and obstructed a federal investigation of a different variety 
by the counselors and accessories of 153974_2020 who obtained a loan 
forn$6 million from STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY and while on 
9/23/2020 obtained another 600 thousand due to their hardships avoided 
prosecution by keeping me pre-occupied and atill carrybthe interest and 
burdens transferred to State Farm in Loan 50074, accrued both unlawful 
and imaginary interest at both HSBC and JP Morgan Chase Bank which is 
used for overnight lending by and between all banks.

             Are those rent receipts matching up with the gross income 
(that is unlawful) matching the income reported to the NY dept of 
Finance as well?

             In that case also has represented their confessions UNDER 
USC 18.225 and USC 18.21 as well as other violations of Security Law, 
namely manipulation of ticker STFGX lost the bulk of its market 
capitalization on December 21,2021.

             Was this also a communal decision to mark its NAV at $106? 
Why not $107? Or $101? There is no material change in holdings reported 
for CIK filer 93715 or 1516523 as thisbwas obstructed by several 
accessories, counselors, and directors of Sullivan Properties LP.

             Continuing Financial Crimes, $20 million / corp, an $10 
million per inividual if you needed cause for obstruction oter than the 
minimum prison sentences implied.

             Enjoy that while you consider how quickly problems get 
resolved for the 55 in an overnight and with my intervention.

             Keep my family our of your affairs, and dont threaten them 
like the voicemail attached here carries a life and potential death 
sentence. Not sure if state farm will cover that as a provision of their 
terms of WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS who are still at risk while you 
play marco polo with the real statutues and laws. Which have statute of 
limitations.

             Voicemail threatening an imaginary case, property and 
deed,  confirmation of participation attached.

             Have a good evening Zucker.

15 U.S. Code =C3?=C2=A7 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; su=
it at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any applic=
ation, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or =
regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration stat=
ement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which s=
tatement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under whic=
h it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shal=
l be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or m=
isleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or =
sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for dama=
ges caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he a=
cted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or =
misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or =
in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the co=
urt may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the=
 costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable at=
torneys=C3=A2=C2?=C2? fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may re=
cover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined=
 in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this=
 section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts =
constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause =
of action accrued.

(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secret=
ary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registe=
red securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to tra=
nsactions in government securities, except where the Commission determine=
s that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and pu=
blishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments i=
n writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published fo=
r comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written commen=
t before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury de=
termines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, wo=
uld, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency =
of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on com=
petition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of t=
his section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, f=
ind that such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the pur=
poses of this section notwithstanding the Secretary=C3=A2=C2?=C2?s determ=

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends o=
n the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent di=
sclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent=
 conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that=
 a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participat=
ion in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to t=
he
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she e=
ngaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the f=
airness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions cove=
red by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)=20
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or princi=
pal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company=
 of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any af=
filiated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, act=
ing as principal-=20
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered c=
ompany or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, unless =
such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer=
, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of =
a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) se=
curities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodi=
c payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any compa=
ny controlled by such registered company, any security or other property =
(except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.=20
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, inden=
ture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company, nor =
any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is organized or adm=
inistered, shall contain any provision which protects or purports to prot=
ect any director or officer of such company against any liability to the =
company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject=
 by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckles=
s disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of t=
his Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not am=
ended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, such =
company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company a=
nd shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expira=
tion date each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commiss=
ion a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to =
the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such pe=
rson subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office file =
a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or a=
greement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser o=
f, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall co=
ntain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person aga=
inst any liability to such company or its security holders to which he wo=
uld otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or =
gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his r=
eckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such contract or ag=
reement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.=20
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district co=
urt of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United St=
ates, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the foll=
owing capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and w=
ithin five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct o=
r gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company fo=
r which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser=
, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end c=
ompany, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse o=
f trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting i=
n such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of ti=
me as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.=20
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in th=
e public interest or for the protection of investors, to require accounta=
nts and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other documents and pa=
pers relating to registered investment companies for such period or perio=
ds as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the same available for in=
spection by the Commission or any member or representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent =
of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of th=
e types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b=
)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 6662=
(h)(2) and =C3?=C2=A7 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion o=
f an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation misst=
atement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



=C3?=C2=A7 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under c=
hapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section =
6664(a) and
=C3?=C2=A7 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitl=
e A of the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial valuati=
on misstatement
under chapter 1 (=C3=A2=C2?=C2?substantial valuation misstatement=C3=A2=C2=
?=C2=9D), there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such=
 portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a gros=
s valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(=C3=A2=C2?=C2?gross valuation misstatement=C3=A2=C2?=C2=9D).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of =
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement unl=
ess the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross =
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as provided=
 in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause =
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in =C3?=C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exceptio=
n to this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unl=
ess

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to sub=
stantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as def=
ined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which ther=
e is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted ba=
sis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of=
 any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term =C3=A2=C2?=C2?property=C3=A2=C2?=C2=
=9D refers to both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and=
 inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to =
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or g=
ross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation mi=
sstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property =
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of =
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-prop=
erty basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B,=
 but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar=
 limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable =
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to s=
ubstantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return is=
 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for propert=
y D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a substa=
ntial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated in apply=
ing the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if the port=
ion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the v=
alue of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the underpayment =
that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D, exce=
eds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a co=
rrect value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or =
more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with =
respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 4=
0 percent.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME =3D $0.00
(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted ba=
sis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of=
 any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term =C3=A2=C2?=C2?property=C3=A2=C2?=C2=

Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and=

(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or g=

The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation mi=

made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property =

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar=

the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable =

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a co=

15 U.S. Code =C3?=C2=A7 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; su=
it at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any applic=
ation, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or =
regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration stat=
ement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which s=
tatement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under whic=
h it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shal=
l be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or m=
isleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or =
sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for dama=
ges caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he a=
cted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or =
misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or =
in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the co=
urt may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the=
 costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable at=
torneys=C3=A2=C2?=C2? fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may re=
cover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined=
 in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this=
 section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts =
constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause =
of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code =C3?=C2=A7 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversig=

(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secret=
ary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registe=
red securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to tra=
nsactions in government securities, except where the Commission determine=
s that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and pu=
blishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments i=
n writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published fo=
r comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written commen=
t before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury de=
termines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, wo=
uld, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency =
of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on com=
petition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of t=
his section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, f=

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends o=
n the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent di=
sclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent=
 conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that=
 a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participat=
ion in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to t=
he
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she e=
ngaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the f=
airness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions cove=
red by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)=20
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or princi=
pal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company=
 of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any af=
filiated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, act=
ing as principal-=20
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered c=
ompany or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, unless =
such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer=
, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of =
a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) se=
curities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodi=
c payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any compa=
ny controlled by such registered company, any security or other property =
(except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.=20
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, inden=
ture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company, nor =
any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is organized or adm=
inistered, shall contain any provision which protects or purports to prot=
ect any director or officer of such company against any liability to the =
company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject=
 by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckles=
s disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of t=
his Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not am=
ended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, such =
company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company a=
nd shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expira=
tion date each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commiss=
ion a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to =
the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such pe=
rson subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office file =
a similar waiver.

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or a=
greement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser o=
f, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall co=
ntain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person aga=
inst any liability to such company or its security holders to which he wo=
uld otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or =
gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his r=
eckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such contract or ag=
reement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.=20
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district co=
urt of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United St=
ates, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the foll=
owing capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and w=
ithin five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct o=
r gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company fo=
r which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser=
, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end c=
ompany, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse o=
f trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting i=
n such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of ti=
me as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.=20
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in th=
e public interest or for the protection of investors, to require accounta=
nts and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other documents and pa=

e of the evidence.

n 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of=
 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is=

USC 18, =C3?=C2=A7216. Penalties and injunctions

    (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 2=
08, or 209 of this title is the following:
        (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall=
 be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount set fort=
h in this title, or both.
        (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the off=
ense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the amo=
unt set forth in this title, or both.
    (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropri=
ate United States district court against any person who engages in conduc=
t constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 o=
f this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the ev=
idence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than =
$50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the person=
 received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is grea=
ter. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection does not pre=
clude any other criminal or civil statutory, common law, or administrativ=
e remedy, which is available by law to the United States or any other per=
son.
    (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is en=
gaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 20=
7, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an approp=
riate United States district court for an order prohibiting that person f=
rom engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting th=
at person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the condu=
ct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition under this secti=
on does not preclude any other remedy which is available by law to the Un=
ited States or any other person.

son.

gaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 20=
7, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an approp=
riate United States district court for an order prohibiting that person f=
rom engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting th=
at person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the condu=
ct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition under this secti=
on does not preclude any other remedy which is available by law to the Un=
ited States or any other person.
