ALL UNDER TITLE 18

TITLE 18, § 1962 - Prohibited activities
     (a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income 
derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity 
or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has 
participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, 
United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part 
of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.
     (b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control 
of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
     (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated 
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, 
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or 
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a 
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
     (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any 
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

TITLE 18, § 1963
     (a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or 
for life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which 
the maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall 
forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State 
law- (1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation 
of section 1962; (2) any- (A) interest in; (B) security of; (C) claim 
against; or (D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a 
source of influence over; any enterprise which the person has 
established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the 
conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and (3) any property 
constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, 
directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt 
collection in violation of section 1962. The court, in imposing sentence 
on such person shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed 
pursuant to this section, that the person forfeit to the United States 
all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise 
authorized by this section, a defendant who derives profits or other 
proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross 
profits or other proceeds. (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture 
under this section includes- (1) real property, including things growing 
on, affixed to, and found in land; and (2) tangible and intangible 
personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims, and 
securities.

ALL UNDER TITLE 18
     § 2 - Principals
         (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or 
aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is 
punishable as a principal.
         (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if 
directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the 
United States, is punishable as a principal.
     § 3 - Accessory after the fact
         Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has 
been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in 
order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an 
accessory after the fact. Except as otherwise expressly provided by any 
Act of Congress, an accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not 
more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding 
section 3571) fined not more than one-half the maximum fine prescribed 
for the punishment of the principal, or both; or if the principal is 
punishable by life imprisonment or death, the accessory shall be 
imprisoned not more than 15 years.
     §4. Misprision of felony
         Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony 
cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as 
soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in 
civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined 
under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
     §6. Department and agency defined
         As used in this title:
         -The term "department" means one of the executive departments 
enumerated in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context shows that such 
term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial 
branches of the government.
         -The term "agency" includes any department, independent 
establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of 
the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a 
proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was 
intended to be used in a more limited sense.

    GROSS RENTS" AS "LAWFUL INCOME" WHEREBY IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO
    ASSESS THE PROPERTLY VALUE ON THE BASIS OF "RHETORICAL" OR
    "CONTROVERSIAL RENT" AS THEY ARE NOT RENTAL UNITS - THEY ARE
    COOPERATIVE APARTMENTS WITHOUT A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, AND THE
    PREMIUMS RECEIVED BY STATE FARM FOR OFFERING AND ACCEPTING A LETTER
    OF CREDIT TO PLAINTIFFS ON MAT 11TH WAS ON THE BASIS OF FICTITUOUS

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

FOR EXAMPLE:

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months,
     to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92 
and to forfeit $2,223,000.

*15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A). *
Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with 
committing wire fraud.

*15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements*
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

*(c)Period of limitations*
*No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.*


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and _*within five years of the commencement of the action*_, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
*(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or*
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
_*If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross 
abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from 
acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such 
period of time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.*_


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to _require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports_, _work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.__
___

DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

**Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction

specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).*

*FOR EXAMPLE:*

*On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, *
*    to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92

*15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements*
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

*(c)Period of limitations*
*No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.*

15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the integrity of industry participants and their commitment to 
transparent disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . 
We have long held that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the securities industry even if the disqualifying 
conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies 
on the fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and 
abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
*SEC. 17. (a) *
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or *promoter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company *(other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

      <br>
      ALL UNDER TITLE 18<br>
      <br>
      TITLE 18, § 1962 - Prohibited activities<br>
          (a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any
      income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of
      racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in
      which such person has participated as a principal within the
      meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or
      invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the
      proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the
      establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in,
      or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
      A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of
      investment, and without the intention of controlling or
      participating in the control of the issuer, or of assisting
      another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if
      the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the members of
      his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any pattern
      or racketeering activity or the collection of an unlawful debt
      after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to one percent
      of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not confer,
      either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors
      of the issuer.<br>
          (b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of
      racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to
      acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
      control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities
      of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.<br>
          (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
      associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of
      which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
      participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
      enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
      collection of unlawful debt.<br>
          (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate
      any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
      section.<br>
      <br>
      TITLE 18, § 1963<br>
          (a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this
      chapter shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
      than 20 years (or for life if the violation is based on a
      racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life
      imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United States,
      irrespective of any provision of State law- (1) any interest the
      person has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962;
      (2) any- (A) interest in; (B) security of; (C) claim against; or
      (D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source
      of influence over; any enterprise which the person has
      established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in
      the conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and (3) any property
      constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person
      obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or
      unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962. The court,
      in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition to
      any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the
      person forfeit to the United States all property described in this
      subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this
      section, a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an
      offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or
      other proceeds. (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under
      this section includes- (1) real property, including things growing
      on, affixed to, and found in land; and (2) tangible and intangible
      personal property, including rights, privileges, interests,
      claims, and securities.<br>
      <br>
      ALL UNDER TITLE 18<br>
          § 2 - Principals<br>
              (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States
      or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its
      commission, is punishable as a principal.<br>
              (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if
      directly performed by him or another would be an offense against
      the United States, is punishable as a principal.<br>
          § 3 - Accessory after the fact<br>
              Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States
      has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the
      offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or
      punishment, is an accessory after the fact. Except as otherwise
      expressly provided by any Act of Congress, an accessory after the
      fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term
      of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more
      than one-half the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of
      the principal, or both; or if the principal is punishable by life
      imprisonment or death, the accessory shall be imprisoned not more
      than 15 years.<br>
          §4. Misprision of felony<br>
              Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a
      felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and
      does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or
      other person in civil or military authority under the United
      States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
      than three years, or both.    <br>
          §6. Department and agency defined<br>
              As used in this title:<br>
              -The term "department" means one of the executive
      departments enumerated in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context
      shows that such term was intended to describe the executive,
      legislative, or judicial branches of the government.<br>
              -The term "agency" includes any department, independent
      establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or
      bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United
      States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that
      such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.<br>

      Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to
      sanction any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was
      associated with an investment adviser, if the Commission finds
      that the sanction is in the public interest and the person has
      been convicted of any offense specified in Section 203(e)(2)
      within ten years of the commencement of proceedings. 15 U.S.C. §

      FOR EXAMPLE:<br>
      <br>
      On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of
      fortyeight months,     <br>
          to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of
      supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of
      $390,243,873.92 and to forfeit $2,223,000. <br>
      <br>
      <b>15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A). </b><br>
      Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa
      with, among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate
      the value of illiquid securities between January 2008 and October
      2008 and with committing wire fraud. <br>
      <br>
      <b>15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements</b><br>
      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
      attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.<br>
      <br>
      (b)Contribution<br>
      Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section
      may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person
      who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to
      make the same payment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(c)Period of limitations</b><br>
      <b>No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created
        under this section unless brought within one year after the
        discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and
        within three years after such cause of action accrued.</b><br>

      15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight
      of self-regulatory organizations<br>
      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;
      or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or
      appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the
      Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that
      such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the
      purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s
      determination.<br>

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the<br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.<br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is<br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of<br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the<br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the<br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged<br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness<br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the<br>
      collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
      market<br>

      SEC. 17. (a) <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal- <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;<br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the
      issuer)<br>

      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.<br>
      SEC. 17. <br>
      (h)     After one year from the effective date of this title,
      neither<br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered

      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.<br>
      <br>
              In the event that any such instrument does not at the
      effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this
      subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the
      expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless
      continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be
      deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date
      each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission
      a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument
      to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and
      each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before
      assuming office file a similar waiver.<br>
      <br>
      (i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his

      district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and <u><b>within five years of the
          commencement of the action</b></u>, of gross misconduct or
      gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment
      company for which such person so serves or acts:<br>
      <b>
        (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board,
        investment adviser, or depositor; or</b><br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>

      <u><b>
          If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or
          gross abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin

          permanently or for such period of time as it in its discretion

        sheets, and other documents and papers relating to registered

      DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS<br>
      SEC. 34.<br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to<br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).<br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a). <br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.<br>

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good

      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the integrity of industry participants and their
      commitment to transparent disclosure.<br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is antithetical to the protection of investors.
      . . . We have long held that a history of<br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the securities industry even if the disqualifying
      conduct is not related to the<br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The
      industry relies on the fairness<br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the collateral bar to forgo opportunities
      to defraud and abuse other market<br>
      participants.<br>

      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.<br>
      <br>
              In the event that any such instrument does not at the
      effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this
      subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the
      expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless
      continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be
      deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date
      each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission
      a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument
      to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and
      each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before
      assuming office file a similar waiver.<br>
      <br>
      (i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such
      contract or agreement.<br>
      <br>
      Injunctions against gross abuse.<br>
      SEC. 36. <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:<br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or<br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>
      certificate company.<br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      SEC. 32. <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the
      Commission or any member or representative thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS<br>
      SEC. 34.<br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to<br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).<br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a). <br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.<br>
