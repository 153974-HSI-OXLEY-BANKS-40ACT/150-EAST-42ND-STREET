                  -Property subject to forfeiture under this section,
          any seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or

          Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
          (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those

                      (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be
          deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>

          and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United
          States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe
          that the property with respect to which the order is sought
          would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture
          under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place

          time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under

          Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and
          (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this
          paragraph.    <br>
              (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                  -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture
          under subsection (b) that the property-<br>

          Weapons Convention; and<br>
                  (2) is of a type and quantity that under the

          disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited

              (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                  -The owner or possessor of any property seized under
