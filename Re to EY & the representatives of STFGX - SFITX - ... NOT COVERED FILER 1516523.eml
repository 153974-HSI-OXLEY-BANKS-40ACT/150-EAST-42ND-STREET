          Opinions on the Financial Statements<br>
          <br>
          We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
          liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State
          Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim
          Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds
          constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively
          referred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of September 30, 20=
21, the
          related statements of operations for the period December 1,
          2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November
          30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for
          each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020,
          including the related notes, and the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred
          to as the =E2=80=9Cfinancial statements=E2=80=9D). In our opinion,=
 the
          financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
          the financial position of each of the Funds as of September
          30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the
          year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net
          assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30,
          2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended
          November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with
          accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
          of America.<br>
          <br>
          Basis for Opinions<br>
          <br>
          These financial statements are the responsibility of the
          Funds=E2=80=99 management. Our responsibility is to express an opi=
nion
          on the Funds=E2=80=99 financial statements based on our audits. We=
 are
          a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
          Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
          required to be independent with respect to the Funds in
          accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
          applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.<br>
          <br>
          We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
          accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
          require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
          reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
          are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
          fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
          of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
          due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
          to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
          basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
          financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
          accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
          management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
          the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation
          of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
          with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received
          from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We
          believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
          opinions.<br>
