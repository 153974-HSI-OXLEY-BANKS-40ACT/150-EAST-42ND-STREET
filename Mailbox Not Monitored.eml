ANNEXED IN THE LOAN DOCKETS AND IN NYSCEF 153974/2020<br><br>

[USC 18.§21, USC 18§225,  USC 18§2, USC 18§1962, USC 18§1963 ----<NYC 
DEPT OF FINANCE - PUBLIC 
RECORDS>](https://github.com/WILSON-ELSER-STATEFARM-SULLIVAN-ZUCKER/WILSON-ELSER-STATEFARM-SULLIVAN-ZUCKER/files/8986215/NYC.DEPT.OF.FINANCE.-.PUBLIC.RECORD.pdf)

USC 18

§21. Stolen or counterfeit nature of property for certain crimes defined

<p>

(a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense that-

   (1) any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, 
altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and

   (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

   -such element may be established by proof that the defendant, after 
or as a result of an official representation as to the nature of the 
property, believed the property to be embezzled, robbed, stolen, 
converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or 
obliterated.

</p>

USC 18

§225. Continuing financial crimes enterprise

<p>

     (a) Whoever-

         (1) organizes, manages, or supervises a continuing financial 
crimes enterprise; and

         (2) receives $5,000,000 or more in gross receipts from such 
enterprise during any 24-month period

     -shall be fined not more than $10,000,000 if an individual, or 
$20,000,000 if an organization, and imprisoned for a term of not less 
than 10 years and which may be life.

     (b) For purposes of subsection (a), the term "continuing financial

657, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1014, 1032, or 1344 of this title, or section 
1341 or 1343 affecting a financial institution, committed by at least 4

</p>

USC 18

§1962. Prohibited activities

<p>

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income 
derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity 
or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has 
participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, 
United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part 
of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control 
of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce.

(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with 
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate 
or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, 
in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of 
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

</p>

§1963. Criminal penalties

<p>

(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the 
maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit 
to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law-

(1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of 
section 1962;

(2) any-

(A) interest in;

(B) security of;

(C) claim against; or

(D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of 
influence over;

any enterprise which the person has established, operated, controlled, 
conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 
1962; and

(3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the 
person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or 
unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962.

The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition 
to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who 
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.

(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-

(1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in 
land; and

(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, 
privileges, interests, claims, and securities.

### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest

(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.

(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-

(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;

(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;

(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92 
and to forfeit $2,223,000.

15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A).

among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with 
committing wire fraud.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements

(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.

Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution

Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations

No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.

[SFITX]

15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations

(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the

integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.

Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is

antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of

egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the

securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the

professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged

in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness

and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the

collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market

participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS

-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS

SEC. 17. (a)

It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-

(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)

Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.

SEC. 17.

(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither

the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.

SEC. 36.

The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of

any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:

(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or

(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount

certificate company.

If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.

SEC. 32.

(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.

DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS

SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to

destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
underpayments

§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.

(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and 
§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see § 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see § 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
(“substantial valuation misstatement” or “gross valuation 
misstatement”), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth in 
section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see § 1.6662-5).

(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent 
of the portion of an underpayment

of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs

(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.

In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),

the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion 
of an underpayment of tax required

to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
misstatement, provided the applicable

dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.

§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.

(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 
6664(a) and

§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A of 
the Code that is

required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement

under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is added 
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1

(“gross valuation misstatement”).

No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment

that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate

of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements

exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs

(b) and

(f)(2) of this section.

This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty

set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.

No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000

($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.

(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.

There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a

return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.

There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax

imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.

For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.

Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.

Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,

contract rights, debts and choses in action.

(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.

The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is

made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,

and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,

there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,

even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),

the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement

is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.

Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

I ANNEXED THESE - JUST IN CASE.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME = $0.00

(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.

There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a

return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.

There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax

imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.

For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.

Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.

Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,

contract rights, debts and choses in action.

(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.

The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is

made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,

and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,

there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,

even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),

the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement

is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.

Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements

(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.

Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution

Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations

No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.

[SFITX]

15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations

(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the

integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.

Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is

antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of

egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the

securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the

professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged

in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness

and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the

collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market

participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS

-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS

SEC. 17. (a)

It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-

(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)

Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.

SEC. 17.

(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither

the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.

SEC. 36.

The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of

any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:

(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or

(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount

certificate company.

If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.

SEC. 32.

(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.

DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS

SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to

destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO YEARS 
SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.

     - TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS 
POINT)

SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE 
STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE 
FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT 
STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE 
ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES 
ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN 
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL - THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..

-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.

ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.

- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.

> THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

IN FACT PRESENTS A GREATER ACTUAL DOLLAR VALUE (IN US DOLLARS) THAN THE

THAT REPRESENTS A 3-YEAR KEY RATE MATURITY.

SEE ALSO, 30-DAY LIBOR IN THE FORMER, OR FED-FUNDS-30, FED-FUNDS-60,

FRIDAY PRICE DAY-ON-DAY, I HAVE SEEN IT AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES BUT NOT

THEY ALSO SELF DECLARE THE VALUE OF THEIR TREASURY BOND SECURITIES, IN

USC 18. VIOLATIONS ANNEXED IN NYSCEF 153974/2020 [ LOAN 50074 ]

§21. Stolen or counterfeit nature of property for certain crimes defined

     (a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense that-

         (1) any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, 
taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and

         (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

             -such element may be established by proof that the 
defendant, after or as a result of an official representation as to the 
nature of the property, believed the property to be embezzled, robbed, 
stolen, converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, 
or obliterated.

             -(b) For purposes of this section, the term "official 
representation" means any representation made by a Federal law 
enforcement officer (as defined in section 115) or by another person at 
the direction or with the approval of such an officer.

     §2. - Principals (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United 
States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its 
commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever willfully causes 
an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be 
an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.

     §3. - Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an offense 
against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, 
comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his 
apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by any Act of Congress, an 
accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more 
than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the 
crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by 
life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty 
years.

                 (15) <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.

     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons

     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.

     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-

         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;

         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and

         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.

     (b) Procedures.-

         (1) General.

         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-

             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and

             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.

         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-

             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.

             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.

             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.

     (c) Affirmative Defense.

         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-

         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and

         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.

     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.

     (e) Assistance.

     (f) Owner Liability.

         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

USC 18, §218. Voiding transactions in violation of chapter; recovery by 
the United States

     In addition to any other remedies provided by law the President or, 
under regulations prescribed by him, the head of any department or 
agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

USC 18, §216. Penalties and injunctions

     (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title is the following:

         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.

         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the 
offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the 
amount set forth in this title, or both.

     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.

     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

*****    USC 18, §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest

     (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-

     -Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this 
title.

     (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-

official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the 
nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, 
application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, 
claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular 
matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives

officer or employee;

         (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of 
Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal

pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or

         (4) if the financial interest that would be affected by the 
particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of 
the officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in 
birthrights-

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum

crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by 
life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty

                 (15) <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.

     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons

     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.

     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-

         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;

         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and

         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.

     (b) Procedures.-

         (1) General.

         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-

             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and

             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.

         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-

             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.

             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.

             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section

      ### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest<br>
      <br>
      (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being
      an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United
      States Government, or of any independent agency of the United
      States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or
      an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including a
      special Government employee, participates personally and
      substantially as a Government officer or employee, through
      decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of
      advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other
      proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
      determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
      arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he,
      his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in which he
      is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or
      employee, or any person or organization with whom he is
      negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
      employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the
      penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
      <br>
      (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government
      official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the
      nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding,
      application, request for a ruling or other determination,
      contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other
      particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial
      interest and receives in advance a written determination made by
      such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be
      deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the
      Government may expect from such officer or employee;<br>
      <br>
      (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
      Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers
      and employees covered by this section, and published in the
      Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from
      the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
      inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
      Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;<br>
      <br>
      (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
      advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
      Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
      appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
      employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
      report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in
      Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the
      individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of
      interest created by the financial interest involved...<br>

      15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements<br>
      <br>
      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
      attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.<br>
      <br>
      (b)Contribution<br>
      <br>
      Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section
      may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person
      who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to
      make the same payment.<br>
      <br>
      (c)Period of limitations<br>
      <br>
      No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created
      under this section unless brought within one year after the
      discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within
      three years after such cause of action accrued.<br>

      15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;
      or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or
      appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the
      Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that
      such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the
      purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s
      determination.<br>

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets

      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is<br>
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of<br>
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the<br>
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the<br>
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged<br>
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies

      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.<br>
      <br>
              In the event that any such instrument does not at the
      effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this
      subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the
      expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless
      continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be
      deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date
      each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission
      a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument
      to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and
      each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before
      assuming office file a similar waiver.<br>

      (i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered

      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:<br>
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or<br>

      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>

      certificate company.<br>
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.<br>

      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the

      (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see §
      1.6662-3);<br>

      <br>
      (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under

      limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see §
      1.6662-5).<br>
      <br>
      (b) Amount of penalty -<br>
      <br>
      (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20
      percent of the portion of an underpayment<br>
      <br>
      of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to
      any of the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs<br>
      <br>

      In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in
      section 6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),<br>
      <br>
      the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the
      portion of an underpayment of tax required<br>
      <br>
      to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross
      valuation misstatement, provided the applicable<br>
      <br>
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      § 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under
      chapter 1.<br>
      <br>
      (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in
      section 6664(a) and<br>
      <br>
      § 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle
      A of the Code that is<br>
      <br>
      required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial
      valuation misstatement<br>
      <br>
      under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is
      added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.<br>
      <br>
      Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of
      a gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1<br>
      <br>
      (“gross valuation misstatement”).<br>
      <br>
      No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
      portion of an underpayment<br>
      <br>
      that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
      misstatement unless the aggregate<br>
      <br>
      of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or
      gross valuation misstatements<br>
      <br>
      exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as
      provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs<br>
      <br>
      (b) and<br>
      <br>
      (f)(2) of this section.<br>
      <br>
      This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable
      cause and good faith exception to this penalty<br>
      <br>
      set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception
      to this penalty.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Dollar limitation.<br>
      <br>
      No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable
      year unless<br>
      <br>
      the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable
      to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000<br>
      <br>
      ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation
      (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));<br>
      <br>
      or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).<br>
      <br>
      This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for
      which there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.<br>
      <br>
      (e) Definitions -<br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both
      tangible and intangible property.<br>
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.<br>
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.<br>
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br>
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.<br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,<br>
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.<br>
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).<br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

      <br>
      (e) Definitions -<br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both
      tangible and intangible property.<br>
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.<br>
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.<br>
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br>
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.<br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,<br>
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.<br>
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).<br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

      15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements<br>
      <br>
      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
      attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.<br>
      <br>
      (b)Contribution<br>
      <br>
      Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section
      may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person
      who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to
      make the same payment.<br>
      <br>
      (c)Period of limitations<br>
      <br>
      No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created
      under this section unless brought within one year after the
      discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within
      three years after such cause of action accrued.<br>

      15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight
      of self-regulatory organizations<br>
      <br>
      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;
      or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or
      appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the
      Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that
      such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the
      purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s
      determination.<br>

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the<br>
      <br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is<br>
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of<br>
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the<br>
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the<br>
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged<br>
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness<br>
      <br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the<br>
      <br>

      SEC. 17. (a)<br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal-<br>
      <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;<br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the

      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.<br>
      <br>
      SEC. 17.<br>
      <br>
      (h)     After one year from the effective date of this title,
      neither<br>
      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.<br>
      <br>
              In the event that any such instrument does not at the
      effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this
      subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the
      expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless
      continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be
      deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date
      each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission
      a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument
      to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and
      each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before
      assuming office file a similar waiver.<br>
      <br>
      (i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such

      Injunctions against gross abuse.<br>
      <br>
      SEC. 36.<br>
      <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:<br>
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or<br>
      <br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>
      <br>
      certificate company.<br>
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      SEC. 32.<br>
      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the
      Commission or any member or representative thereof.<br>

      DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS<br>
      <br>
      SEC. 34.<br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to<br>
      <br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).<br>
      <br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a).<br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.<br>

      WHERE STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I
      PUT THE CLAUSE FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT
      PROVISION WAS SO THAT STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR
      RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE

      <br>
      §21. Stolen or counterfeit nature of property for certain crimes
      defined<br>
      <br>
          (a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense
      that-<br>
      <br>
              (1) any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted,
      taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or
      obliterated; and<br>
      <br>
              (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such
      character;<br>
      <br>
                  -such element may be established by proof that the
      defendant, after or as a result of an official representation as
      to the nature of the property, believed the property to be
      embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered,
      counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated.<br>
      <br>
                  -(b) For purposes of this section, the term "official
      representation" means any representation made by a Federal law
      enforcement officer (as defined in section 115) or by another
      person at the direction or with the approval of such an officer.<br>
      <br>
          §2. - Principals (a) Whoever commits an offense against the
      United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or
      procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever
      willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by
      him or another would be an offense against the United States, is
      punishable as a principal.<br>
      <br>
          §3. - Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an
      offense against the United States has been committed, receives,
      relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or
      prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory
      after the fact. Except as otherwise expressly provided by any Act

      constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted
      use, or threatened use of physical force against property or
      against the person of another in violation of the laws of the
      United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of
      that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours
      to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be

      (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
      section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
      complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence
      at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a
      preponderance of the evidence.<br>
      <br>
          (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section
      that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime

      immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

      <br>
          (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.<br>
      <br>
          -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to
      the United States irrespective of any provision of State law-<br>
      <br>
              (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or
      used by a person involved in the offense;<br>
      <br>
              (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and
      proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the
      result of such violation; and<br>
      <br>
              (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to
      commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.<br>
      <br>
          The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order,
      in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section
      229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all property
      described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise
      authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived profits or
      other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice
      the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
      <br>
          (b) Procedures.-<br>
      <br>
              (1) General.<br>
      <br>
              -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any
      seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or
      judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by
      subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive
      Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853),
      except that any reference under those subsections to-<br>
      <br>
                  (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed
      to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
      <br>
                  (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference
      to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
      <br>
              (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
      <br>
                  (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture
      proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may
      be entered upon application of the United States without notice or
      opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has
      not yet been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition
      to the circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the
      Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21
      U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is
      probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which
      the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject
      to forfeiture under this section and exigent circumstances exist
      that place the life or health of any person in danger.<br>
      <br>
                  (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a
      temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also
      issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
      <br>
                  (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time
      limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section
      413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
      Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to
      temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.<br>
      <br>
          (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
      <br>
              -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
      subsection (b) that the property-<br>
      <br>
              (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical
      Weapons Convention; and<br>
      <br>
              (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances
      is consistent with that purpose.<br>
      <br>
          (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
      shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition
      of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this
      section.<br>
      <br>
          (e) Assistance.<br>
      <br>
          (f) Owner Liability.<br>
      <br>
              -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this
      section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses
      incurred incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating
      to the handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other
      disposition of the seized property<br>

      department or agency involved, may declare void and rescind any
      contract, loan, grant, subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise,

      States or officer or employee of the United States or person
      acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been a
      final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United
      States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty
      prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the
      thing transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable
      value thereof.<br>

      USC 18, §216. Penalties and injunctions<br>
      <br>
          (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205,
      207, 208, or 209 of this title is the following:<br>
      <br>
              (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the
      offense shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in
      the amount set forth in this title, or both.<br>
      <br>
              (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting
      the offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or
      fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.<br>
      <br>
          (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the
      appropriate United States district court against any person who
      engages in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204,
      205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such
      conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be
      subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each
      violation or the amount of compensation which the person received
      or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is
      greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection
      does not preclude any other criminal or civil statutory, common
      law, or administrative remedy, which is available by law to the
      United States or any other person.<br>
      <br>
          (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a
      person is engaging in conduct constituting an offense under
      section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title, the
      Attorney General may petition an appropriate United States
      district court for an order prohibiting that person from engaging
      in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting that
      person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the
      conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition
      under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is
      available by law to the United States or any other person.<br>

              (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such
      character;<br>

      to the nature of the property, believed the property to be
      embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered,
      counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated.<br>

      section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
      complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence
      at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a
      preponderance of the evidence.<br>
      <br>
          (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section
      that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime
      because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission,
      because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is
      immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

      <br>
          (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.<br>
      <br>
          -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to
      the United States irrespective of any provision of State law-<br>
      <br>
              (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or
      used by a person involved in the offense;<br>
      <br>
              (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and
      proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the
      result of such violation; and<br>
      <br>

      commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.<br>
      <br>
          The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order,
      in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section
      229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all property
      described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise
      authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived profits or
      other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice
      the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
      <br>
          (b) Procedures.-<br>
      <br>
              (1) General.<br>
      <br>
              -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any
      seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or
      judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by
      subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive
      Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853),
      except that any reference under those subsections to-<br>
      <br>
                  (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed
      to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
      <br>
                  (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference
      to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
      <br>
              (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
      <br>
                  (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture
      proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may
      be entered upon application of the United States without notice or
      opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has
      not yet been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition
      to the circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the
      Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21
      U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is
      probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which
      the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject
      to forfeiture under this section and exigent circumstances exist
      that place the life or health of any person in danger.<br>
      <br>
                  (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a
      temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also
      issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
      <br>
                  (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time
      limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section
      413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
      Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to
      temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.<br>
      <br>
          (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
      <br>
              -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
      subsection (b) that the property-<br>
      <br>
              (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical
      Weapons Convention; and<br>
      <br>
              (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances
      is consistent with that purpose.<br>
      <br>
          (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
      shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition
      of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this
      section.<br>
      <br>
          (e) Assistance.<br>
      <br>
          (f) Owner Liability.<br>
      <br>
              -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this
      section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses
      incurred incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating
      to the handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other
      disposition of the seized property<br>

          In addition to any other remedies provided by law the
      President or, under regulations prescribed by him, the head of any
      department or agency involved, may declare void and rescind any
      contract, loan, grant, subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise,
      use, authority, privilege, benefit, certificate, ruling, decision,
      opinion, or rate schedule awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or

      delivery of any thing to, by or for any agency of the United
      States or officer or employee of the United States or person
      acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been a
      final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United
      States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty
      prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the
      thing transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable
      value thereof.<br>

      <br>

      fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.<br>
      <br>
          (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the

      engages in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204,
      205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such
      conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be
      subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each
      violation or the amount of compensation which the person received
      or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is
      greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection
      does not preclude any other criminal or civil statutory, common
      law, or administrative remedy, which is available by law to the
      United States or any other person.<br>
      <br>
          (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a
      person is engaging in conduct constituting an offense under
      section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title, the
      Attorney General may petition an appropriate United States
      district court for an order prohibiting that person from engaging
      in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting that
      person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the
      conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition
      under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is
      available by law to the United States or any other person.<br>

      inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
      Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;<br>
      <br>
              (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving
      on an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal

      disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics
      in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for
      the individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict
      of interest created by the financial interest involved; or<br>
      <br>
              (4) if the financial interest that would be affected by
      the particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the

      to be the Government official responsible for appointment.<br>
      <br>
          (2) The potential availability of an exemption under any
      particular paragraph of subsection (b) does not preclude an
      exemption being granted pursuant to another paragraph of
      subsection (b).<br>
      <br>
          (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any determination granting an
      exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made
      available to the public by the agency granting the exemption
      pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics
      in Government Act of 1978. In making such determination available,
      the agency may withhold from disclosure any information contained
      in the determination that would be exempt from disclosure under
      section 552 of title 5. For purposes of determinations under
      subsection (b)(3), the information describing each financial
      interest shall be no more extensive than that required of the
      individual in his or her financial disclosure report under the
      Ethics in Government Act of 1978.<br>
      <br>
          (2) The Office of Government Ethics, after consultation with

      interests that are not so substantial as to be deemed likely to
      affect the integrity of the services the Government may expect
