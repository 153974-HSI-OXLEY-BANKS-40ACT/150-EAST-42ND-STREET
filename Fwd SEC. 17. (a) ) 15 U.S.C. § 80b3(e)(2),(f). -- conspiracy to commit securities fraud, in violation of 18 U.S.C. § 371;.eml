          (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of
          good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
          Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in
          any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this
          chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any
          undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided
          in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which
          statement was at the time and in the light of the
          circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with
          respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person
          (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who,
          in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold
          a security at a price which was affected by such statement,
          for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued
          shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
          that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking
          to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court
          may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment

          (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of

          rule filed by a registered securities association that
          primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in

          that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary

          Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment

          transparent disclosure.<br>
          Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
          fraudulent conduct is<br>
          antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have
          long held that a history of<br>
          egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
          participation in the<br>
          securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
          related to the<br>
          professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when
          he or she engaged<br>
          in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry
          relies on the fairness<br>
          and integrity of all persons associated with each of the

          would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,

          or transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which
          is required pursuant to section 31 (a). <br>

          <b>15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements</b><br>
          (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of
          good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
          Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in
          any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this
          chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any
          undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided
          in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which
          statement was at the time and in the light of the
          circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with
          respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person
          (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who,
          in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold
          a security at a price which was affected by such statement,
          for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued
          shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
          that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking
          to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court
          may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment
          of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs,
          including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party

          (b)Contribution<br>
          Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this

          any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have

          15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and
          oversight of self-regulatory organizations<br>
          (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of
          the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed
          rule filed by a registered securities association that
          primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in
          government securities, except where the Commission determines
          that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary
          action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of
          the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a
          proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
          Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
          before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
          Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such
          rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely
          affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for
          government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on
          competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
          purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to
          adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary
          and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section

          [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and
          markets depends on the integrity of industry participants and
          their commitment to transparent disclosure.<br>
          Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
          fraudulent conduct is antithetical to the protection of
          investors. . . . We have long held that a history of<br>
          egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
          participation in the securities industry even if the
          disqualifying conduct is not related to the<br>
          professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when
          he or she engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding.
          The industry relies on the fairness<br>
          and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
          professions covered by the collateral bar to forgo
          opportunities to defraud and abuse other market<br>
          participants.<br>

          any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of
          the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in
          one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, after
          the enactment of this title and within five years of the
          commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse
          of trust in respect of any registered investment company for
          which such person so serves or acts:<br>

          investment adviser, or depositor; or<br>
          (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
          open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>
          certificate company.<br>
          If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or

          It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting,
