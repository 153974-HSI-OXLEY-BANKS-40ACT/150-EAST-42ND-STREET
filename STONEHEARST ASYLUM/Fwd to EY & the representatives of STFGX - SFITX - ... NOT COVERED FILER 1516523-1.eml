THE VIOLATION OF PRIVACY, IS CLEAR – AND SO IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE

TENANTS - THEY DON'T HAVE A WARRANT TO ILLEGALLY VIDEOTAPE, OR A 
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY TO LEGALLY COLLECT AND CUSTODY RENT OR SECURITY 
DEPOSITS. FOR BUILDINGS - PLURAL...*

THIS IS A NEW PLATEAU OF DEPLORABLE CONDUCT AS THE LIABILITY FOR 
INVESTORS, WHERE THE REGULATORS ARE CONSIDERED AS "NONPLUSSED" AND 
WITHOUT DISCLOSURE TO THE PUBLIC…
- WHILE I WAS FURTHER HINDERED BY THE OBSTRUCTION BY OTHER COUNSELORS, 
AND AFFILIATES WHILE THE STATE FARM ATTEMPTED A MERGER IN NOVEMBER OF 
2021 AS WELL.

                 NO RELEASE OR NOTICE OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION BY THE 
SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR ALL OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES TO 
BE CONCERNED WITH REGARDING THIS DANGER

NOTWITHSTANDING FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO A TRUST THAT WILL NOT DISCLOSE A 
$6 MILLION DOLLAR EXPOSURE

THE LETTER OF CREDIT FOR $6 MILLION WAS ANNEXED AND RECEIVED IN A NEW 
YORK SUPREME COURT OF LAW, DOCKET 315...

- THEY WILL ALSO HIDE A $6 BILLION DOLLAR LOSS.***AND WILL NOT ACCEPT 
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT COVERED, AND UNDER ANY SCOPE OF LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS AS WELL.
         - THIS ALL OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF THEIR OWN BOND 
INDENTURE AND COVERAGE FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS... AND I ALSO FILED A 
TCR ON THE 13TH OF NOVEMBER - PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION TERM.

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, 
including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State 
Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal 
Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, 
hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 
2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 
2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, 
the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial 
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the 
results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the 
changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of 
the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ 
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting 
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect 
to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included 
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in 
Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

STATE FARM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 3487



Opinions on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying 
statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of 
investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State 
Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds 
constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred 
to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of 
operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 
and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net 
assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and 
for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, 
including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of 
the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the 
“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each 
of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their 
operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 
and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net 
assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and 
for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each 
of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Basis for Opinions***These financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our 
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We 
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those 
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our 
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures 
included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

            Opinions on the Financial Statements<br>
            <br>
            We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
            liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of
            State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm
            Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of
            the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter
            collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30,
            2021, the related statements of operations for the period
            December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year
            ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net
            assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30,
            2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended
            November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the
            financial highlights for each of the periods indicated
            therein (collectively referred to as the “financial
            statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
            present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
            position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the
            results of each of their operations for the period December
            1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended
            November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets
            for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021
            and for each of the two years in the period ended November
            30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of
            the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting
            principles generally accepted in the United States of
            America.<br>
            <br>
            Basis for Opinions<br>
            <br>
            These financial statements are the responsibility of the
            Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our
            audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
            Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
            (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
            the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
            laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
            Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.<br>
            <br>
            We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
            accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
            require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
            reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
            are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
            fraud.    <br>
            <br>
            Our audits included performing procedures to assess the
            risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
            whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
            that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
            examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
            and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
            included evaluating the accounting principles used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as
            evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
            statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
            securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
            with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not
            received from brokers, we performed other auditing
            procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
            basis for our opinions.<br>

            Opinions on the Financial Statements We have audited the
            accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
            the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund,
            State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State
            Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting
            Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred
            to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related
            statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020
            through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30,
            2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period
            December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of
            the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020,
            including the related notes, and the financial highlights
            for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively
            referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion,
            the financial statements present fairly, in all material
            respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of
            September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations
            for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021
            and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of
            their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through
            September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the
            period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial
            highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
            the United States of America. Basis for Opinions***These
            financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’
            management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
            the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits. We are
            a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
            required to be independent with respect to the Funds in
            accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
            applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
            Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits
            of these financial statements in accordance with the
            standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
            whether the financial statements are free of material
            misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
            included performing procedures to assess the risks of
            material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
            due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
            respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,
            on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
            disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
            included evaluating the accounting principles used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as
            evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
            statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
            securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
            with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not
            received from brokers, we performed other auditing
            procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
            basis for our opinions.<br>
