P.16 (revisited)




Comprehensive proposals to address structural fire risks were contained in =
the recommenda=C2=AD tions of the 1973 America Burning report. The wisdom o=
f these recommendations was acknowledged by the Congress and the Administra=
tion in the enactment of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 197=
4 (the =E2=80=9C1974 Act=E2=80=9D). However, FEMA and the USFA have not pur=
sued many of the preventive measures authorized by that statute; the Congre=
ss has not appropriated the funds necessary to carry them out; they have no=
t been adequately advocated by USFA; and if implementation is the test, the=
y have not been widely accepted by the fire service-at-large. Since 1974, s=
uccessful approaches for implementing mitigation measures have been develop=
ed, but have not been incorporated in comprehensive programs to reduce stru=
ctural fire loss. In addition, FEMA has not applied to the fire problem tho=
se lessons which it learned with respect to other natural hazards, includin=
g earthquake, flood, and hurricane and has failed to exercise all of its po=
wers under the 1974 Act.
















P.7




In addition, the Commission considered obtaining input from the fire servic=
es commu=C2=AD nity and others through various other means:

=E2=98=85 Mail (both traditional and electronic or =E2=80=9Cemail=E2=80=9D)=
 comments were numerous and extremely useful to the members. Over 50 pieces=
 of written "mail" corre=C2=AD spondence were received that either provided=
 comments on relevant subjects, provided enclosed publications or other wri=
tten material for the Commission=E2=80=99s information, or offered assistan=
ce to the Commission in its work;

=E2=98=85 In order to take advantage of the growing use of personal compute=
r tech=C2=AD nologies, the Commission established a web site so that commen=
ts could be received from virtually everywhere. Nearly 200 comments were re=
ceived from over 45 States and two foreign countries. Excerpts from the sub=
mitted comments are included in various locations in this report; and

=E2=98=85 Had there been more time, the Commission would have conducted "fi=
eld" meetings in various U.S. regional locations. This approach may yet be =
possi=C2=AD ble to develop detailed and grass roots oriented strategies for=
 carrying out some of the Commission=E2=80=99s recommendations.







Staff, which supported the efforts of the members of the Commission, spent =
consider=C2=AD able time after the June sub-group meeting researching furth=
er the existing written and electronic databases that underlay the findings=
 of the May 3rd report. As a result, there are, for example, data to suppor=
t aggressive implementation campaigns for the Commission=E2=80=99s recommen=
dations with respect to prevention. In those instances that data can be emp=
loyed now to accelerate achievement of the Commission=E2=80=99s recom=C2=AD=
 mendations, FEMA/USFA is strongly urged to do so. Moreover, the effort to =
collect quantitative data should be continued. However, the Commission reco=
gnizes that encyclopedic data for all the recommendations may not exist, or=
, in several instances, will be some time in compilation.

Specific issues that the sub-group identified as warranting specific follow=
-on attention include:

=E2=98=85 The hazard and risk management issues and requirements associated=
 with fires located generally at the point of urban/wildland interface. The=
 requirements can be separated into a) effective (for realty loss preventio=
n) and safe (for firefighters) response and suppression capability and b) t=
he reduction of existing wild fire hazard and the avoidance of new wild fir=
e risks through effective mitigation techniques. The issues associated with=
 these requirements include appropriate forest management, sound land use a=
nd community growth principles, training and equipment, research and data, =
and partnerships to overcome obstacles such as resources, awareness, and lo=
ng- term commitments;

The societal and criminal issues associated with the risk of arson, and par=
tic=C2=AD ularly the challenge of dealing with juvenile fire setters. In la=
rge part, due to the convergence of the arson fire issue with the arson cri=
me issue, there are substantial data on the arson problem in America that c=
an be, and indeed have been, used to develop and implement effective arson =
prevention strate=C2=AD gies. Notable effective strategies for addressing t=
he arson and the juvenile fire setter problems have been carried out in the=
 City of Utica, New York and Orange County, California, respectively; and

The management and customer service issues associated with the evolution of=
 the fire services not only as a profession, but also as a business. This i=
ssue is an umbrella for several of the specific matters addressed in the Ma=
y 3rd report =E2=80=93 such as diversity, health of firefighters, and the a=
ppropriate imple=C2=AD mentation of emergency medical services =E2=80=93 as=
 well as with issues indirectly referred to in that report =E2=80=93 such a=
s the ability of community fire services to attract financial and human res=
ources; the capacity of the fire service to effec=C2=AD tively work within =
America=E2=80=99s evolving societal circumstances, and the expansion of the=
 fire services into hazard and disaster management areas that are increasin=
gly critical to the sustainability of today=E2=80=99s communities.




P.12




A prime example of the failure to adequately implement America Burning has =
been the unwillingness of the federal government to fund the USFA and ancil=
lary programs at anywhere near the recommended level of $153 million. The i=
nitial funding in 1980 was only $24 million ($45,130,000 in year 2000 dolla=
rs) and twenty five years later, for fiscal year 2000, it is only $42,982,0=
00, an actual decrease of 4.7 percent, reflect=C2=AD ing inflation.




Although deaths from fire have fallen from 7,395 in 1977 to 4,035 in 1998, =
those lost lives are not accept=C2=AD able. One-hundred and tenfirefighters=
 died in the line of duty in 1998. Despite the occasional periodic sympathy=
 generated by tragedies such as the loss of six firefighters in Worcester, =
Massachusetts in December 1999, fire deaths receive little nationwide atten=
tion and sparse legislative and funding response. Since the Worcester fire,=
 USFA has been notified of 40 firefighter fatalities and estimates that an =
additional 1,800 civilian lives have been lost from fires.




P.15




The Commission reached two major conclusions:

(1) The frequency and severity of fires in America do not result from a lac=
k of knowledge of the causes, means of prevention or methods of suppression=
. We have a fire =E2=80=9Cproblem=E2=80=9D because our nation has failed to=
 adequately apply and fund known loss reduction strategies. Had past recomm=
endations of America Burning and subsequent reports been implemented, there=
 would have been no need for this Commission. Unless those recommendations =
and the ones that follow are funded and imple=C2=AD mented, the Commission=
=E2=80=99s efforts will have been an exercise in futility.

The primary responsibility for fire prevention and suppression and action w=
ith respect to other hazards dealt with by the fire services properly rests=
 with the states and local governments. Nevertheless, a substantial role ex=
ists for the federal government in funding and technical support.

(2) The responsibilities of today=E2=80=99s fire departments extend well be=
yond the traditional fire hazard. The fire service is the primary responder=
 to almost all local hazards, protecting a community=E2=80=99s com=C2=AD me=
rcial as well as human assets and firehouses are the closest connection gov=
ernment has to disaster-threatened neighborhoods. Firefighters, who too fre=
quently expose themselves to unneces=C2=AD sary risk, and the communities t=
hey serve, would all benefit if there was the same dedication to the avoida=
nce of loss from fires and other hazards that exists in the conduct of fire=
 suppression and rescue operations.




P.16




Implementation of Loss Prevention Strategies

The strategies and techniques to address fire risks in structures are known=
. When implement=C2=AD ed, these means have proven effective in the reducti=
on of losses. The tragic reality, however, is that existing and effective s=
trategies have not been funded adequately by the Congress or state and loca=
l governments, nor have they been aggressively advocated by the United Stat=
es Fire Administration (USFA) and other fire service constituencies. As a c=
onsequence, America today has the highest fire losses in terms of both freq=
uency and total losses of any modern technological society. Losses from fir=
e at the high rate experienced in America are avoidable and should be as un=
acceptable as deaths and losses caused by drunk driving or deaths of childr=
en accidentally killed playing with guns.

Comprehensive proposals to address structural fire risks were contained in =
the recommenda=C2=AD tions of the 1973 America Burning report. The wisdom o=
f these recommendations was acknowledged by the Congress and the Administra=
tion in the enactment of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 197=
4 (the =E2=80=9C1974 Act=E2=80=9D). However, FEMA and the USFA have not pur=
sued many of the preventive measures authorized by that statute; the Congre=
ss has not appropriated the funds necessary to carry them out; they have no=
t been adequately advocated by USFA; and if implementation is the test, the=
y have not been widely accepted by the fire service-at-large. Since 1974, s=
uccessful approaches for implementing mitigation measures have been develop=
ed, but have not been incorporated in comprehensive programs to reduce stru=
ctural fire loss. In addition, FEMA has not applied to the fire problem tho=
se lessons which it learned with respect to other natural hazards, includin=
g earthquake, flood, and hurricane and has failed to exercise all of its po=
wers under the 1974 Act.




Recommendations 1

The Congress should increase its involvement in fire loss prevention in Ame=
rica and exercise more fully its oversight responsibilities under the 1974 =
Act. The Congress should also appropriate for the fire problem appropriate =
resources commensurate with those it provides to community policing or high=
way safety. FEMA should exercise its full authority under the 1974 Act and =
should apply to the fire hazard the same prevention emphases and strategies=
 that it has applied to other natural hazards, the Agency=E2=80=99s objecti=
ve being an all-risk, multi-hazard loss prevention progra




Recommendation 2

FEMA/USFA should develop a long-term implementation strategy for fire sprin=
=C2=AD klers and smoke alarms. The plan should include the following implem=
entation aspects:

=E2=98=85 The approach should be community based;

=E2=98=85 No tactic or strategy should detract from the requirement for spr=
inklers. Smoke alarms (or other measures) should always be the locality=E2=
=80=99s second option as a loss reduction measure;

=E2=98=85 Exploration of the technical, economic and practical aspects of u=
tilizing alarm and sprinkler systems that provide automatic notification to=
 a firehouse. These systems should be professionally maintained and monitor=
ed;

=E2=98=85 Confirmation of the accuracy of the belief that the appropriatene=
ss of the emplacement of sprinklers and alarms may be based on rural and ur=
ban dis=C2=AD tinctions, and whether other distinctions such as residential=
 construction, commercial construction and critical facilities may also be =
appropriate;

=E2=98=85 The plan should distinguish between requirements for new construc=
tion and existing construction.

The plan should articulate actions that will result in:

=E2=98=85 Improved use of financial incentives;

=E2=98=85 Government leadership in including fire safety measures in its ow=
n buildings, and in those that it helps construct or for which it provides =
any form of financial assistance or guarantee;

=E2=98=85 Prioritization standards in the retrofit of existing buildings ba=
sed on risk to the public;

=E2=98=85 A national public awareness and education campaign;

=E2=98=85 Participation of the private and academic sectors;

=E2=98=85 Improvement of technologies and lowering of costs;

=E2=98=85 Inclusion and enhancement of fire safety requirements in model bu=
ilding codes and standards; and

=E2=98=85 The plan should complement communities=E2=80=99 actions to addres=
s all their haz=C2=AD ards. For example, the ability of a community to addr=
ess fire hazards should not be compromised by an earthquake event that rupt=
ures sprinkler systems.







P.18

Recommendation 3

Loss Prevention Education for the Public

The most effective way to reduce the loss of life from natural and man-made=
 disasters is through a multi-hazard mitigation process that addresses all =
the hazards a community faces. Currently, FEMA has begun a community-based,=
 all-risk program entitled, Project Impact: Building Disaster Resistant Com=
munities. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has also begun a =
program entitled Risk Watch, which includes many of the approaches of Proje=
ct Impact.=C2=A0




Recommendations:

These mitigation programs should be combined in a unified all-hazard learn=
=C2=AD ing curriculum and implemented nationally by community and neighborh=
ood fire services in all levels of the local school systems. Fire departmen=
ts should be encouraged to spend even more time in reaching out to children=
 in schools and other venues. By providing a community-based and complete p=
ackage to educators, fire service representatives can work from the same ba=
seline of information to ensure that a consistent message is sent nationwid=
e.

In addition, effective public service commercials demonstrating the risks a=
nd avoidance techniques for fire and other hazards should be pursued. The s=
uc=C2=AD cess of such federal initiatives as seat belt use hold great promi=
se for public education on the issues of fire.

Further findings and Recommendations with respect to the issues of public e=
ducation and awareness will be presented in #7 below.




Recommendation 4 & 5 , R&D




P.20-21




Recommendations:

FEMA/USFA should develop a plan to effect appropriate data collection and a=
nalysis. The plan should include a reconciliation of existing FEMA data sys=
=C2=AD tems, as well as identifying adequate levels of funding needed to re=
vive both data collection and data analysis and use. Resources to achieve t=
he plan should also be identified and pursued. The plan should include the =
following actions and aspects:

=E2=98=85 FEMA and USFA should facilitate or initiate working partnerships =
that further efforts to institutionalize the compatibility of data on the p=
art of allied organiza=C2=AD tions and agencies. The all-hazards aspect can=
 also be reflected by including organizations such as the Insurance Service=
s Office (ISO), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the Bureau=
 of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the U.S. Geological Survey, the Na=
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and others.

=E2=98=85 FEMA/USFA should also have state government partners in the colle=
ction of data. To this end, FEMA/USFA should encourage state collection of =
data by providing financial incentives through the grant process.

=E2=98=85 There should be a one-time examination of the practicality of dev=
eloping a statis=C2=AD tical sampling model that can be utilized by the var=
ious regions, states and local communities as appropriate.

=E2=98=85 For the national data center to be effective and efficient and to=
 be adequately fund=C2=AD ed, there should be a transparent process for the=
 setting of the agenda for the center so that problem-focused analyses can =
be prioritized and shared with its part=C2=AD ners. In some instances, it m=
ay also be feasible for such partners to perform needed analyses on their o=
wn initiative.

=E2=98=85 After-action data, which is not currently collated, should be col=
lected and ana=C2=AD lyzed by the center. Such data should identify the pre=
-event activities, (e.g., preventive actions, codes or standards, training)=
 and response activities (including equipment, techniques, etc.) proved mos=
t effective.










Improvements Through Research

Research on the science of fire, fire behavior, the suppression and extingu=
ishing of fire, and fire service operations is inadequate. Valuable investi=
gation is currently being conducted in Federal Agencies, such as the Consum=
er Product Safety Commission and the National Institute of Standards and Te=
chnology (NIST). However, this research is not coordinated, prioritized or =
focused on identified problems. Valuable research is also ongoing at many o=
f the Nation's col=C2=AD leges and universities and there is also a private=
 sector component of research into fire and emergency services issues that =
may contribute to a national agenda.

The transfer of research results into practice can also be improved. First,=
 technology transfer is not facilitated by the Federal sector in any effici=
ent manner. The private sector has extensive relationships with most of the=
 fire research community, and it is these (informal) relationships that see=
m to result in most of the technology transfer. Conversely, it is equally i=
mportant that the end-user, the practicing fire and emergency services comm=
unity, be able to communicate to the research community its problems and is=
sues,=E2=80=A6







Item 6

P.22




Codes and Standards for Fire Loss Reduction in the Built Environment

There should be an active and aggressive approach by FEMA/USFA in the utili=
zation of build=C2=AD ing codes and standards for construction in order to =
prevent or reduce fire losses. To date, there has been success in the use o=
f codes and standards. However, the success must be accelerated and intensi=
fied.

The adoption and enforcement of those codes and standards for construction =
or rehabilitation that affect fire safety (as well as safety for all hazard=
s) must be extended. The Commission's discussions focused on the need to ad=
dress more of the residential losses, the potential losses in existing (or =
new) critical facilities, and the losses in structures that contain vulnera=
ble popu=C2=AD lations (e.g., retirement homes). Changes to model codes and=
 standards that reflect research that validates the revisions would thus pr=
ovide the technical basis for local and state adoption and enforcement of m=
easures that address local and state risk management priorities.




Recommendations:

The USFA should review its authority under the Fire Prevention and Control =
Act of 1974 in order to identify those activities it could support, but cur=
rently does not, with respect to building codes and standards. These activi=
ties would include:

=E2=98=85 The development and promulgation of a set of performance standard=
s for build=C2=AD ings, with respect to fire hazards and risks, against whi=
ch model codes and standards can be measured for equivalency. The participa=
tion and consensus processes used by FEMA to develop such standards for sei=
smic vulnerability in buildings may serve as a useful paradigm;

=E2=98=85 The active involvement of the fire services community in the cons=
ensus process of model code promulgation gives the drafters the benefit of =
real experience in the prevention and suppression of fire and to ensure tha=
t the current trend towards =E2=80=9Cequivalency=E2=80=9D does not unintent=
ionally put firefighters at additional risk;

=E2=98=85 The development of training courses on the enforcement of buildin=
g and fire codes in new and existing buildings at the National Fire Academy=
 (NFA) that can be handed off to state and local governments. In addition, =
USFA should utilize its present and emerging academic partnerships with col=
leges and universities that have architectural and engineering programs to =
ensure that fire safety inspections

=E2=98=85 The National Institute of General Medical Science (NIGMS) has a d=
iscrete and diverse program in Trauma and Burn Injury.

=E2=98=85 It should be noted that burn-related research is considered a sub=
set of trauma, and thus is not tracked or administered separately from trau=
matic injury as a whole.

=E2=98=85 The Trauma and Burn Injury Program at NIGMS supports research pro=
ject grant awards to investiga=C2=AD tors from all disciplines. The program=
 is designed to accommodate research from the molecular level up to and inc=
luding outcome studies on injured patients, and ranging from the immediate =
post-injury response to resolution of the injury including studies of any c=
omplications.

=E2=98=85 Dramatic improvements have taken place over the past 20 to 30 yea=
rs in the United States, partic=C2=AD ularly in the major burn centers. The=
 recent advances in the care of burn victims may be viewed as both a direct=
 and indirect consequence of support from NIGMS in particular and NIH in ge=
ner=C2=AD al. Additionally, numerous advances in the fundamental knowledge =
of the pathophysiology of burn injury have been made that have not yet been=
 extended to clinical practice. Many questions and problems remain to be ad=
dressed and solved.




=E2=98=85 Brief descriptions of these Institutes=E2=80=99 relevant research=
 projects are as follows:

=E2=98=85 National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): The N=
IAAA currently supports two projects that investigate the effects of alcoho=
l on trauma, including burn injury.

=E2=98=85 National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Dise=
ases (NIAMS):

The NIAMS has a significant portfolio of projects on wound healing, includi=
ng healing that follows burn wounds.

=E2=98=85 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD):=
 The NICHD is pursuing novel interventions to burn injury management that f=
all into two basic cate=C2=AD gories: pain management and tissue regenerati=
on.

=E2=98=85 National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH): The research portfoli=
o of NIMH in the area of traumatic stress includes studies focusing on the =
biological, psychological, and social factors that influence the mental hea=
lth consequences of trauma, including fires and burn injuries.

=E2=98=85 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): The NHLBI does=
 not have a spe=C2=AD cific program on burns and non-tobacco smoke inhalati=
on injury, although the Institute has an active interest in research relate=
d to smoke inhalation injuries

been analyzed. The results have suggested procedures to prevent recurrences=
.

=E2=98=85 BFRL is investigating the thermal performance of the fire fighter=
 protective clothing under relative=C2=AD ly low heat flux exposures. The c=
ombination of data and the understanding embodied in user-friendly software=
 can aid fire fighter equipment manufacturers in the design of cost- effect=
ive, higher performance protective ensembles. This technology can also be c=
ast in a slightly different form to train fire fighters about the limitatio=
ns of their protective equipment.

=E2=98=85 BFRL is working with the detection and alarm industry to enable t=
he display and transfer of vital building information during fire emergenci=
es.

=E2=98=85 BFRL is developing a standard icon-based system for use in the vi=
sual display of information in advanced fire alarm panels and probable fire=
 service hand-held decision aid devices of the future.

=E2=98=85 BFRL is quantifying the marks left by experiments that simulate a=
