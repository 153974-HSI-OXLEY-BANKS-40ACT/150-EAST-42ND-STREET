*Mr. Moore,*

*Judith Craig from the FDIC reached out and pointed out to Morgan Stanley
as the brokerage arm with respect to this matter and in April. To no avail,
have not responded and continue in their dealings without concern, even
write research reports for your competitor [BRK-B] while collecting
premiums for selling shares on a =E2=80=9Cpart time=E2=80=9D basis for you =
and yours.  *

*At this point, I don't expect the FDIC to review any of this directly -
however I thank them for the guidance. The material party, as instructed by
Miss Craig, has failed to respond to any substantive request to myself and
also to your own Auditor, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
commission.*

*In a separate message, Mr. Moore (State Farm) did reach out to me and I
attempted to schedule a call, I also emailed** a conglomerate of State
Farm=E2=80=99s advisors and representatives who have failed to return or re=
spond to
my email, and despite the risks which are in fact a growing liability of
State Farm on a daily basis. I believe there is a certain "conflict of
interest", or a lack of understanding =E2=80=94 which unfortunately is some=
thing
that may come back to the FDIC and without further clarification from State
Farm with respect to my position and during the period of my residency. *

*I reached out to you in August of 2020 and solely based on what was
reported in State Farm=E2=80=99s SEC filings and also with the New York Cit=
y
Department of Finance. This was to avoid a certain deterioration to the
Assets held by State Farm, hence I must insist and warn you in advance =E2=
=80=94
that any gross neglect as seen in the posthaste filings under the
advisement of your brokers can and should be avoided.*

*In this instance, and without any =E2=80=9Cdemand=E2=80=9D for payment on =
my part, on the
basis of the "frequency of penalties which are known" infractions by State
Farm; historically are outweighed by the severity and consequences suffered
by certain third party service providers =E2=80=93 namely in their unfair d=
ealings,
neglect, and ethical procedures.*

*The Violation of Privacy issues are known by the executives and directors
of Sullivan Properties LP, Morgan Stanley, notwithstanding the counselors
and affiliated companies of the Zucker Organization. It is important that I
speak with someone at State Farm to avoid a certain conflict, solely on the
basis of the contractual obligations filed with the New York Department of
Finance. Those omissions I have discovered as reported to the Securities
and Exchange Commission have created a paper trail of old and new investors
that are invited, however bereft of the underlying risks prior to
purchasing subscriptions in your umbrella of Mutual Funds. *

*The extent of liability, and with my sole reliance on the provisions
presented to Donald Zucker in writing on the 11th of May **by =E2=80=9CStat=

Realty Mortgage LLC=E2=80=9D, as 'FIDELITY' of the State Farm Assurances Fu=

Adviser=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CBroker Dealer=E2=80=9D and under the new Advi=
sers Investment Trust. *

*This was executed under the former 'State Farm Assurances Funds Trust' in
fiscal year 2020 and as of current is NOT understood as a substantive risk,
and is not reported. Which is the reason why it is important that you make
arrangements to speak with me as soon as possible. *

*This artifact (=E2=80=9C50074=E2=80=9D) was notarized and by its managing =
agent =E2=80=9CState
Farm Life Insurance Company=E2=80=9D, was filed while I resided at 111 Rear
Sullivan Street, New York, NY, 10012. The degree of negligence and
understanding by those counselors is deplorable as seen in the proceedings
initiated by Sullivan Properties LP, however I can assure you this again a
good faith attempt by myself to help you understand and explain to you
where the omissions, obstruction, and conduct as exemplified by Morgan
Stanley=E2=80=99s involvement is also reciprocated in the dictum of Pricewa=
terhouse
Coopers. *

*As it stands, you own the rights to the leases and rents for the six
properties in question, and the covenants which are unique to each lot are
complicated=E2=80=A6*

*The fiduciary roles and opinions of your advisory in this respect are
tainted, and also conflicted having on multiple occasions represented no
concern having reviewed the semi-annual and annual reports on behalf of
State Farm as their 'Promoters, and brokers'. Those statements filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission are the only means whereby an
investors confidence and reliance of the risks implied for both the 'State
Farm Assurances Funds Trust' are represented by the omissions of PWC,
however due to the =E2=80=9Cnon-responsive=E2=80=9D brokers, as promulgated=
 and filed under
the new 'Advisers Investment Trust' by PWC. *

*As an obligations of State Farm and the terms of its prospectus while
operating as the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust, in a transfer of the
leases and rents for cash, represents a liability encumbered by several
properties which were transferred to State Farm in May of 2020. The extent
of the liability, however, is beyond the scope of your understanding for
moral and ethical consideration =E2=80=93 should not be neglected by State =
Farm in
this respect and on behalf of its investors.*

*I would recommend that you make arrangements to speak with me, independent
of the ZUCKERS or their counselors, and to avoid any further =E2=80=9Cconfl=
icted
advisement=E2=80=9D. If you feel comfortable holding the implied liabilitie=
s
without speaking with me, I respect your decision and can only wish the
best for you and yours in the future. *

*I can assure you the underlying risks were obstructed by the counselors in
the matter of 153974/2020; even having said this, I would implore that you
make arrangements to discuss this matter with me directly at 646-256-3609,
or via email at your earliest possible convenience. *

*This is not a letter of demand by any means, and a good faith attempt on
my own time to provide you with an unbiased opinion and a =E2=80=9Cnon-conf=

*Thank you again for your guidance in this matter Judith, I will get back
to you, and hopefully after speaking with Mr. Moore and State Farm in the
coming week. *

*Please enjoy your weekends, and also understand that I will help you to
clear the risk of your involvement(s) with matters which pertain to item
50074, and more importantly =E2=80=94 without a certain deluge of informati=
