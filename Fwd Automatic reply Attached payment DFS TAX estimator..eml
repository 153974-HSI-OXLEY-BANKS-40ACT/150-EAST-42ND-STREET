 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant o=
bservable inputs are not available.
These inputs, based on the best information available in the circumstances, w=
ould include reasonably available information about the assumptions that a m=
arket participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and might incl=
ude SFIMC=E2=80=99s own data.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less obse=
rvable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requir=

ng fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Opinions on the Fina=

  EX-99.CERT
January 28, 2021
Basis for Opinions
JANUARY 28, 2021
We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, inclu=
ding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Bal=
anced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (cons=
tituting State Farm Associates=E2=80=99 Funds Trust, hereafter collectively r=
eferred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of November 30, 2020, the rela=
ted statements of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020, the state=
ments of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended=
 November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlight=
s for each of the five years in the period ended November 30, 2020 (collecti=
vely referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinancial statements=E2=80=9D).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material res=
pects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of November 30, 2020, t=
he results of each of their operations for the year then ended, the changes i=
n each of their net assets for each of the two years in the period ended Nov=
ember 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the five yea=
rs in the period ended November 30, 2020 in conformity with accounting princ=
iples generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds=E2=80=99 mana=
gement. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 fi=
nancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm regi=
stered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (P=
CAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accord=
ance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regu=
lations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the=
 standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform th=
e audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement=
s are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material mi=
sstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and p=
erforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included e=
xamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in=
 the financial statements.
  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and sig=
nificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall pre=
sentation of the financial statements.
Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2=
020 by correspondence with the custodian. We believe that our audits provide=
 a reasonable basis for our opinions.

There is an expectation that hotel rooms are private spaces, and most people=
 can relate to Andrews=E2=80=99s experience as incredibly invasive. Barrett a=
dmitted in a 2012 deposition that he filmed up to 10 other women at hotels u=
sing the same method of tampering with peepholes (which he learned from watc=
hing a hotel employee at different hotel). The combination of the familiarit=
y of staying at a hotel, the revelation that Barrett=E2=80=99s act was not a=
n isolated incident, and the perception that a simple phone call to Andrews c=
ould have prevented everything, would have seriously violated jurors=E2=80=99=
 expectations, eroded their feelings of safety, and ignited personal fears a=
nd protective instincts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Opinions on the Financial Statements November 22, 2021
We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, inclu=
ding the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Bal=
anced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (cons=
tituting State Farm Associates=E2=80=99 Funds Trust, hereafter collectively r=
eferred to as the =E2=80=9CFunds=E2=80=9D) as of November 30, 2020, the rela=
ted statements of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020, the state=
ments of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended=
 November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlight=
s for each of the five years in the period ended November 30, 2020 (collecti=
vely referred to as the =E2=80=9Cfinancial statements=E2=80=9D).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material res=
pects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of November 30, 2020, t=
he results of each of their operations for the year then ended, the changes i=
n each of their net assets for each of the two years in the period ended Nov=
ember 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the five yea=
rs in the period ended November 30, 2020 in conformity with accounting princ=
iples generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds=E2=80=99 mana=
gement. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds=E2=80=99 fi=
nancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm regi=
stered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (P=
CAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accord=
ance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regu=
lations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the=
 standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform th=
e audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement=
s are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material mi=
sstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and p=
erforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included e=
xamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
   =20
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi=
ficant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall prese=
ntation of the financial statements.
Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30,=
 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were no=
t received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe t=
hat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

   Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material=
 misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, an=
d performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include=
d examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures=
 in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi=
ficant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall prese=
ntation of the financial statements.
Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30,=
 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were no=

hat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

here is an expectation that hotel rooms are private spaces, and most people c=

mitted in a 2012 deposition that he filmed up to 10 other women at hotels us=
ing the same method of tampering with peepholes (which he learned from watch=
ing a hotel employee at different hotel). The combination of the familiarity=
 of staying at a hotel, the revelation that Barrett=E2=80=99s act was not an=
 isolated incident, and the perception that a simple phone call to Andrews c=
ould have prevented everything, would have seriously violated jurors=E2=80=99=
