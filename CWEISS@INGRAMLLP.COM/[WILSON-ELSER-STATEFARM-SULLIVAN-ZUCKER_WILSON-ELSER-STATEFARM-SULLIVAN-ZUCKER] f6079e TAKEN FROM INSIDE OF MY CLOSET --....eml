Monday, March 7: Day 10=0D
A Nashville jury awarded Andrews $55 million. Jurors found Barrett 51 per=
cent at fault in the case, which would mean he would have to pay $51 perc=
ent of the award. The jury said Windsor Capital Group and the hotel owner=
, West End Hotel Partners, also were at fault=0D
and were on the hook for the remaining 49 percent.=0D
=0D
Friday, March 4: Day 9=0D
Attorneys hashed out jury instructions and delivered their closing argume=
nts. Andrews' attorneys said Barrett was a liar who the jury should not b=
elieve. Barrett testified via video deposition - after he was forced to d=
o so by a judge - that he got Andrews' room number using an administrativ=
e phone at the hotel.=0D
=0D
Defense attorneys want the jury to believe that story. They say Barrett w=
as an insurance executive who traveled more than 200 nights a year and th=
us knew how to deceive the system to get access to Andrews.=0D
=0D
But Andrews' attorney, Bruce Broillet, said Barrett was not believable be=
cause of documents that show he requested a room next door, and say that =
even if he used a staffonly phone, the hotel is still liable because it s=
hould not have given him access.=0D
Barrett has already been deemed liable to some extent. But the jury will =
weigh additional questions: Is Windsor Capitol Group at fault? Was Windso=
r an agent of West End Hotel Partners?=0D
=0D
(A "yes" answer to this question would mean West End Hotel Partners could=
 have to pay damages). What portion of the fault are each Barrett and Win=
dsor responsible for? How much should be awarded in total damages?=0D
Thursday, March 3: Day 8=0D
=0D
The defense rested its case about 1:30 p.m., and Andrews' lawyers did not=
 put on what are called rebuttal (or extra) witnesses.=0D
=0D
The defense's last witness was former NFL player Jesse Palmer, who worked=
 on ESPN's Thursday night college football crew with Andrews in 2008 and =
2009. He said he was amazed at Andrews' on-air performance at her first g=
ame back after the videos were leaked,=0D
calling her a professional. He also said she was subject to sexual commen=
ts before the videos were leaked, and said she had additional security af=
ter the incident. Jacqueline Dement, who checked Barrett into the Nashvil=
le hotel the day he recorded the video, said she would not have seen his =
request to room next to Andrews. If she had seen the request, Dement said=
 she would have followed procedure to first check with Andrews. (Andrews =
testified previously that never happened.)=0D
=0D
Dement was speaking generally, however, and said she did not specifically=
 remember checking Barrett into the hotel.=0D
Wednesday, March 2: Day 7=0D
=0D
Stephen Barth, a professor at the University of Houston's Conrad N. Hilto=
n hospitality management college, testified for the defense that based on=
 his review of the case, hotel staff did not violate procedures in place =
in 2008. He suggested Andrews=E2=80=99 lawyers were asking the jury to ma=
ke assumptions about what actions hotel staff might have taken to let Bar=
rett book the room next door to the television broadcaster. Erin Andrews'=
 stalker a terrorist, expert says Herman Turk, a vice president for Winds=
or, oversaw the hotel in 2008. He said he had full confidence that the st=
aff followed rules and procedures, and said it was very unlikely front de=
sk staff would have seen Barrett=E2=80=99s request to room next to Andrew=
s that was taken at a reservation center.=0D
=0D
He said the local hotel excelled in a secret inspection performed by Marr=
iott three months before Barrett checked in. Kimberly Brown, a psychologi=
st at Vanderbilt University, said she evaluated Andrews three times, diag=
nosing her with mild post-traumatic stress disorder. She said she believe=
d=0D
Andrews=E2=80=99 symptoms would disappear with treatment.=0D
=0D
Tuesday, March 1: Day 6=0D
Andrews' lawyers closed their case after the television broadcaster's tes=
timony. Andrews started the day on the witness stand to continue her dire=
ct testimony, but soon faced crossexamination by Marc Dedman, an attorney=
 for the hotel operator. Dedman suggested in his=0D
questioning that the nude videos had helped Andrews' career more than hur=
t it. He asked Andrews to confirm numerous commercials and other endorsem=
ents she's made since the videos.=0D
=0D
As an early witness in the defense case, Patrick Donaher testified via hi=
s video deposition that Andrews seemed nervous when she covered her first=
 football game after the videos=0D
were released, but that she was still well liked and respected. Donaher w=
as a talent coach who critiqued Andrews' on-the-job performance.=0D
=0D
Lewis Kay, Andrews' publicist and manager, testified via video deposition=
 and said that the stalking case did influence Andrews' decisions on what=
 jobs to take on. He noted she was very successful and said one goal of h=
is was to expand her audience beyond sports.=0D
=0D
=0D
Monday, Feb. 29: Day 5 Andrews took the stand and in tearful testimony de=
scribed how she got bombarded by media coverage after the videos went vir=
al, and how she feared for her safety before her stalker was arrested. Sh=
e said people bring up the videos or jeer at her each time she covers=0D
a game. The 37-year-old said hotel staff never notified her a man was try=
ing to stay next door. If she had known, she said, she would have called =
police. Andrews said she knew filing her civil lawsuit would revive media=
 coverage, which she blamed for part of her humiliation, but said she had=
 to stand up for herself and others. In emotional plea, Erin Andrews blam=
es hotel Andrews' mother, Paula Andrews, sobbed during her daughter's tes=
timony and rested her head on her husband Steve's shoulder. Paula Andrews=
 said her daughter was driven to succeed despite her fear the videos woul=
d end her career.=0D
=0D
"I almost think she=E2=80=99s trying to compensate and keep in control th=
at aspect of her life," Paula=0D
=0D
=0D
Barrett testified via video deposition earlier Monday. He said he filmed =
about 10 women through hotel peepholes, but targeted Andrews because she =
was popular online and he wanted to sell the videos of her for money. He =
said he called to confirm Andrews was staying at the hotel by making it s=
eem it was his own reservation. In a hotel restaurant he used a house pho=
ne and asked to be transferred to her room. The hotel phone showed her ro=
om number, he said.=0D
=0D
Thursday, Feb. 25: Day 4=0D
The jury watched two videos of Andrews taken by her stalker: 4=C2=BD minu=
tes of footage from the Nashville Marriott and a six-second clip shot in =
an Ohio hotel. One woman on the jury occasionally looked away from the vi=
deos. A tearful Andrews left the courtroom while the videos played. Berna=
rd "Jim" Jansen, a computer scientist and professor at Penn State, was hi=
red by Andrews' team. He said he searched the Web and determined the vide=
os or still images of Andrews nude had been seen by more than 16.8 millio=
n people between July 2009 and January 2016.=0D
=0D
Expert says 16.8 million saw Erin Andrews nude  Andrews=E2=80=99 psychoth=
erapist, Loren Comstock, testified that repeated media coverage of what h=
as been dubbed by some as the =E2=80=9Cpeephole case=E2=80=9D has bred an=
xiety in Andrews.=0D
=0D
Comstock=E2=80=99s testimony was via video of her deposition taken in May=
 2015. She said Andrews became obsessed with checking media coverage each=
 morning and feared she would be known for the nude video and not her wor=
k as a sports broadcaster. =E2=80=9CShe couldn=E2=80=99t get through the =
day without fear and anxiety,=E2=80=9D Comstock said, adding that Andrews=
 was still functioning and doing her job.=0D

delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion. Justices Neville and H=
yman concurred in the judgment and opinion. OPINION =C2=B6 1 In 2008, whi=
le plaintiff, Erin Andrews, was a guest of The Blackwell Inn (Blackwell),=
 she was secretly recorded on video in the privacy of her hotel room by a=
nother guest, Michael David Barrett. Plaintiff filed this action sounding=
 in negligence and invasion of privacy against defendant, Preferred Hotel=
 Group (Preferred),1 the service provider of Blackwell=E2=80=99s online r=
eservation system, for, among other things, Blackwell=E2=80=99s disclosur=
e of the details of her hotel stay to Barrett. Plaintiff=E2=80=99s theory=
 of liability is that Preferred was either (1) engaged in a joint venture=
 operation of the hotel or (2) voluntarily assumed a duty to protect plai=
ntiff=E2=80=99s privacy. Preferred moved to dismiss the complaint pursuan=
t to sections 2-615 and 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code)=
 (735 ILCS 5/2-615, 2-619(a)(9) (West 2010)) arguing that it did not owe =
a duty to plaintiff and was not engaged in a joint venture to operate Bla=
ckwell. After two years of discovery, the circuit court granted Preferred=
=E2=80=99s section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appeals from =
the dismissal, which we affirm for the following reasons. =C2=B6 2 BACKGR=
OUND =C2=B6 3 Relevant to plaintiff=E2=80=99s claims against Preferred, t=
he following facts are taken from the complaint. On February 4, 2008, And=
rews was a guest at Blackwell located in Columbus, Ohio. Blackwell is own=
ed and operated by Ohio State University (OSU). In the days leading up to=
 her hotel stay, Illinois resident Michael David Barrett contacted Blackw=
ell by phone to confirm that Andrews was staying at the hotel and asked t=
o be assigned the room next door to her. Blackwell granted Barrett=E2=80=99=
s requests. After checking into the hotel on February 4, Barrett retrofit=
ted the peephole on Andrew=E2=80=99s hotel room door. In doing so, he was=
 able to record video of her activities in the room, including changing a=
nd dressing. Eventually, he posted these videos on the Internet. 1 Plaint=
iff=E2=80=99s complaint also contained allegations against other defendan=
ts for similar events that occurred at other hotels on other dates. Those=
 counts were all dismissed on procedural grounds. - 3 - =C2=B6 4 Defendan=
t Preferred is a corporation with its principal place of business in Chic=
ago, Illinois. It provides marketing, sales and reservation services to i=
ts network of hotels for a fee. Blackwell is a member of Preferred=E2=80=99=
s network and utilizes Preferred=E2=80=99s marketing and Internet reserva=
tion services. Andrews alleged that Preferred is liable for Blackwell=E2=80=
=99s staff disclosing her hotel stay and room number to Barrett and assig=
ning him the room next door to her, without her prior consent thereby all=
owing him to engage in his tortious activities. =C2=B6 5 Plaintiff=E2=80=99=
s theory of liability is that Preferred =E2=80=9Cowned, operated, control=
led, maintained, managed, supervised, handled reservations for and/or wer=
e otherwise responsible for The Blackwell Inn=E2=80=9D and that Blackwell=
 =E2=80=9Cwas the agent and/or joint venture of Preferred *** acting with=
in the course, scope and authority of said agency and/or venture.=E2=80=9D=
 Preferred =E2=80=9Chad a duty to exercise reasonable and ordinary care a=
nd action in and about the ownership, management, maintenance, supervisio=
n, control and operation of Blackwell and its reservation system, and eac=
h of their employees, agents, servants and independent contractors, all t=
o the benefit of the guests.=E2=80=9D Preferred was =E2=80=9Cnegligent in=
 the selection, hiring, training and supervision of each and every other =
defendant as an agent and/or joint venturer.=E2=80=9D Plaintiff also alle=
ged that Preferred and OSU were associated with the purpose of =E2=80=9Cc=
arrying out a specific enterprise for profit.=E2=80=9D Preferred and OSU =
had a community of interest and proprietary interest in Blackwell; Prefer=
red had a right to govern the hotel=E2=80=99s policies and share in the h=
otel=E2=80=99s profits and losses. Based on this theory, plaintiff allege=
d claims against Preferred for negligent infliction of emotional distress=
 and invasion of privacy. =C2=B6 6 In response to the complaint, Preferre=
d filed a hybrid motion to dismiss under section 2-619.1 of the Code, whi=
ch permits a party to combine a section 2-615 motion to dismiss with a se=
ction 2-619 motion to dismiss. 735 ILCS 5/2-619.1 (West 2010). Preferred =
argued that the claims must be dismissed pursuant to section 2-615 of the=
 Code because plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to support the =
conclusory allegation that Preferred owed plaintiff a legal duty. Preferr=
ed also argued dismissal of the claims pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) of=
 the Code because Preferred did not owe a duty to plaintiff for the acts =
of Blackwell=E2=80=99s staff, there was no principal-agent or joint ventu=
re relationship between Preferred and Blackwell and Preferred had no know=
ledge that Andrews was a guest at the hotel. =C2=B6 7 Attached to Preferr=
ed=E2=80=99s motion to dismiss was a written agreement governing the rela=
tionship between Preferred and OSU. The preamble to the agreement provide=
s that Preferred =E2=80=9Cis a service organization designed to provide m=
arketing, sales and reservation services to member hotels.=E2=80=9D In re=
turn for these services, Blackwell pays membership and booking fees to Pr=
eferred, it agrees to =E2=80=9Cconform strictly=E2=80=9D with Preferred=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9CQuality Assurance Program=E2=80=9D (Standards of Excelle=
nce) and allows Preferred =E2=80=9Cto evaluate the quality of the propert=
y and related services rendered at the hotel *** from time to time *** an=
d bear the cost of these evaluations.=E2=80=9D The agreement explains tha=
t Preferred will invoice Blackwell every 30 days for any amounts owed and=
 if any amounts remain unpaid after 60 days, Preferred has the right to s=
uspend all services and charge 1.5% per month on the unpaid sums. =C2=B6 =
8 The affidavit of Xen Riggs, the associate vice president of administrat=
ion and planning at OSU, was also attached to Preferred=E2=80=99s motion =
to dismiss. In this affidavit, Mr. Riggs attested that Blackwell is owned=
 by OSU, its operations are governed by OSU=E2=80=99s board of trustees a=
nd it is managed by OSU=E2=80=99s office of administration and planning. =
Blackwell runs a deficit, but if it were to make a profit, any profit wou=
ld solely benefit OSU. Preferred does not have any - 4 - employees at Bla=
ckwell, does not handle any phone calls to Blackwell, and does not have a=
ny involvement in the operations or management of Blackwell. =C2=B6 9 Als=
o supporting Preferred=E2=80=99s motion was the affidavit of Ken Mastrand=
rea, Preferred=E2=80=99s executive managing director of corporate operati=
ons. Mr. Mastrandrea averred that Preferred provides online hotel reserva=
tion services to Blackwell via Preferred=E2=80=99s Internet booking engin=
e (iBook). Blackwell maintains a link to iBook on its website. Preferred=E2=
=80=99s involvement with reservations made with Blackwell are limited to =
those made through the iBook platform. A guest inputs the reservation inf=
ormation into iBook, which then electronically sends the reservation requ=
est to Blackwell=E2=80=99s computer system, and if accepted, the guest re=
ceives electronic confirmation including the room rate and type. Preferre=
d=E2=80=99s involvement with reservations at Blackwell is limited to prov=
iding the platform for the electronic transmittal of reservation confirma=
tion to and from the hotel and its guests via the Internet. If room reser=
vations are made other than through iBook, Preferred does not have access=
 to any guest identity or information. Preferred never has had access to =
Blackwell=E2=80=99s guest list or any guest=E2=80=99s room number. Prefer=
red has no access to any information regarding guests who booked their ro=
oms directly through the hotel or through any other means. Because Prefer=
red does not have access to guest identities or guest room numbers, if so=
meone called their office requesting this information, Preferred could no=
t give the caller any such information. =C2=B6 10 Mr. Mastrandrea also at=
tested that Preferred has no ownership interest in the hotel and does not=
 share in its profits or losses. Preferred charges Blackwell a fee for me=
mbership in the network and for its booking services. Preferred has no in=
volvement in the operation or management of its member hotels, including =
Blackwell=E2=80=99s policies and procedures regarding safety and/or priva=
cy. There are no =E2=80=9CPreferred=E2=80=9D employees at Blackwell or an=
y of its member hotels and it does not handle phone calls placed to the m=
ember hotels. According to Preferred=E2=80=99s records, Andrews=E2=80=99s=
 reservation was not made through Preferred=E2=80=99s system, and therefo=
re, it had no knowledge that Andrews was a guest at the hotel. Barrett ma=
de a reservation through iBook on Blackwell=E2=80=99s website for which P=
referred was paid a service fee. However, Preferred=E2=80=99s actions in =
respect to Barrett=E2=80=99s reservation were limited to the electronic r=
eservation request automatically generated through the hotel=E2=80=99s co=
mputer system and a confirmation notice sent to Barrett over the Internet=
. =C2=B6 11 At plaintiff=E2=80=99s request, the circuit court permitted d=
iscovery regarding the matters raised in the motion to dismiss. This disc=
overy was conducted over a two-year period and included the deposition of=
 Mr. Mastrandrea. =C2=B6 12 At his deposition, Mastrandrea testified that=
 Preferred=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CStandards of Excellence=E2=80=9D are compri=
sed of =E2=80=9C1600 items of guest service standards that we provide to =
the hotel to manage their service to guests.=E2=80=9D Member hotels are r=
equired to comply with the standards. Once a year, third-party independen=
t inspectors perform a check to determine the level of compliance. The in=
spectors prepare a report that informs the hotels of their aggregate comp=
liance score and ways to improve. A follow-up inspection is required only=
 if a hotel falls below 70% compliance. The compliance reports are review=
ed by one of Preferred=E2=80=99s regional managers. A Preferred executive=
 only reviews an inspection report if the compliance score is lower than =
70%. Preferred relies on the hotels to make the inspector=E2=80=99s sugge=
sted corrections. If corrections are not successfully made, Preferred mig=
ht request an improvement plan from the hotel and follow up as needed. If=
 a hotel still fails to remediate, then Preferred reviews the results and=
 possibly extends the improvement plan or takes further action. Preferred=
 has close to 800 - 5 - member hotels. In its history Preferred has termi=
nated its relationship with only three or four hotels. All of Blackwell=E2=
=80=99s inspections have exceeded a 70% compliance rate, and therefore, n=
o executive at Preferred has been referred to review Blackwell=E2=80=99s =
reports. There are no standards or inspection criteria that address hotel=
 staff informing a third party about other guests staying at the hotel or=
 granting a guest=E2=80=99s request to be placed in the hotel room next t=
o another guest without prior consent. =C2=B6 13 After completion of disc=
overy, plaintiff filed a written response to the motion to dismiss. Plain=
tiff argued that Preferred=E2=80=99s motion should be denied because it w=
as a =E2=80=9Cdisguised motion for summary judgment,=E2=80=9D Preferred=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9C =E2=80=98evidence=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D merely refutes pla=
intiff=E2=80=99s ultimate facts, which does not constitute affirmative ma=
tter, and a question of fact exists as to whether Preferred owed a duty o=
f care to plaintiff. Plaintiff asserted that Preferred owed her a duty of=
 care because either it was in a joint venture with OSU in the operation =
of Blackwell or Preferred voluntarily assumed a duty of care. Plaintiff c=
ontended that because Preferred requires its member hotels to comply with=
 the =E2=80=9CStandards of Excellence=E2=80=9D that includes matters of p=
rivacy (communicating a guest=E2=80=99s room number in writing rather tha=
n verbally and requiring identification before issuing a duplicate key), =
Preferred voluntarily assumed a duty to protect the privacy of guests at =
its member hotels. Plaintiff also argued that Preferred exercised control=
 over the safety measures and policies of Blackwell and these actions cre=
ated a joint venture, giving rise to Preferred=E2=80=99s liability for th=
e actions of Blackwell=E2=80=99s staff. =C2=B6 14 After the hearing, the =
circuit court granted Preferred=E2=80=99s motion to dismiss pursuant to s=
ection 2-619(a)(9) of the Code. The circuit court found that the parties=E2=
=80=99 discovery established that =E2=80=9C[t]he relationship between Pre=
ferred and Blackwell was limited to services provided for electronic tran=
smittal of requests to Blackwell in transmission of confirmation numbers =
back to guests.=E2=80=9D The agreement between Preferred and OSU/Blackwel=
l was the =E2=80=9Climitation of the undertaking,=E2=80=9D and the discov=
ery established that Preferred does not have access to room numbers or ot=
her information concerning guests. Preferred is simply =E2=80=9Ca contrac=
t service provider; they charge for their services and they get paid for =
their services.=E2=80=9D Although plaintiff alleged that Preferred and OS=
U were engaged in a joint venture, plaintiff was unable to provide the co=
urt with any evidence to dispute Preferred and OSU=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ccon=
tractual relationship.=E2=80=9D Preferred and OSU=E2=80=99s written agree=
ment for services defined their duties =E2=80=9Cwhich do *** not cover th=
e conduct alleged in the complaint,=E2=80=9D and therefore, Preferred can=
not be held liable to plaintiff for the acts of Blackwell=E2=80=99s staff=
. In view of this ruling, the circuit court found Preferred=E2=80=99s sec=
tion 2-615 motion to dismiss moot and also ordered that there was =E2=80=9C=
not [sic] just reason for delay of appeal or enforcement of this order.=E2=
=80=9D Thereafter, plaintiff timely filed this appeal. =C2=B6 15 ANALYSIS=
 =C2=B6 16 First, plaintiff argues that Preferred=E2=80=99s motion was im=
properly designated as a motion to dismiss and, therefore, should have be=
en denied outright. Plaintiff contends that the motion was a =E2=80=9Cdis=
guised=E2=80=9D summary judgment motion that did not involve an =E2=80=9C=
affirmative matter=E2=80=9D but merely refuted plaintiff=E2=80=99s well-p=
led allegations. In response, defendant disagrees and argues that if its =
arguments for dismissal were more appropriate for summary judgment rather=
 than section 2-619 dismissal, reversal is only required where the nonmov=
ant was prejudiced by the misdesignation. - 6 - =C2=B6 17 =E2=80=9CThe pu=
rpose of a section 2-619 motion to dismiss is to dispose of issues of law=
 and easily proved issues of fact at the outset of litigation=E2=80=9D (V=
an Meter v. Darien Park District, 207 Ill. 2d 359, 367 (2003)) and is =E2=
=80=9Csimilar to a summary judgment motion because [it] =E2=80=98*** esse=
ntially amounts to a summary judgment procedure.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D Peter=
son v. Randhava, 313 Ill. App. 3d 1, 9 (2000) (quoting Malanowski v. Jaba=
moni, 293 Ill. App. 3d 720, 724 (1997)). These types of motions are simil=
ar because in order to rule on them we must determine =E2=80=9Cwhether th=
e existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the=
 dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether the dismissal is pro=
per as a matter of law.=E2=80=9D Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long =
Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 254 (2004). Misdesignation of a motion for summar=
y judgment as a motion to dismiss is not fatal to the movant=E2=80=99s ri=
ght to prevail where the nonmoving party did not suffer any prejudice or =
unfair surprise due to the error. Peterson, 313 Ill. App. 3d at 9. =C2=B6=
 18 Here, the affirmative matter presented in Preferred=E2=80=99s motion =
is that it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff because it did not hav=
e a principal-agent or joint venture relationship with the hotel and did =
not otherwise voluntarily undertake a duty of care. To support its motion=
, Preferred attached to its motion a copy of the written agreement betwee=
n Preferred and OSU/Blackwell and the Riggs and Mastrandrea affidavits. O=
ver the course of two years, the circuit court permitted the parties to c=
onduct written and oral discovery on the matters raised in Preferred=E2=80=
=99s motion. Therefore, in this instance, where a defined issue was raise=
d in Preferred=E2=80=99s motion and plaintiff was granted time to conduct=
 lengthy discovery on Preferred=E2=80=99s assertions, we find that, wheth=
er viewed as a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, plaint=
iff was not prejudiced in the designation of the motion to dismiss as a m=
otion under section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code. =C2=B6 19 The circuit court =
dismissed plaintiff=E2=80=99s complaint pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) o=
f the Code, which permits the involuntary dismissal of a claim where the =
claim asserted is =E2=80=9Cbarred by other affirmative matter avoiding th=
e legal effect of or defeating the claim.=E2=80=9D 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9)=
 (West 2010). Affirmative matter is =E2=80=9Csomething in the nature of a=
 defense which negates the cause of action completely or refutes crucial =
conclusions of law or conclusions of material fact contained in or inferr=
ed from the complaint.=E2=80=9D Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.=
 2d 469, 486 (1994). =E2=80=9CUnless the affirmative matter is already ap=
parent on the face of the complaint, the defendant must support the affir=
mative matter with an affidavit or with some other material that could be=
 used to support a motion for summary judgment.=E2=80=9D Pleasant Hill Ce=
metery Ass=E2=80=99n v. Morefield, 2013 IL App (4th) 120645, =C2=B6 21. O=
nce a defendant has presented adequate affidavits or other evidence of su=
pport, =E2=80=9C =E2=80=98the defendant [has] satisfie[d] the initial bur=
den of going forward on the motion=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D and the burden then=
 shifts to the plaintiff who is required to establish that the affirmativ=
e matter is either unfounded or involves an issue of material fact. Reyno=
lds v. Jimmy John=E2=80=99s Enterprises, LLC, 2013 IL App (4th) 120139, =C2=
=B6 37 (quoting Kedzie & 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill.=
 2d 112, 116 (1993). A plaintiff may overcome this burden by presenting =E2=
=80=9Caffidavits or other proof.=E2=80=9D 735 ILCS 5/2-619(c) (West 2010)=
. However, a plaintiff cannot rely on the allegations from his own compla=
int to refute such evidence. Hollingshead v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 3=
96 Ill. App. 3d 1095, 1101-02 (2009). In addition, if a plaintiff does no=
t come forward with a counteraffidavit refuting the evidentiary facts in =
the defendant=E2=80=99s affidavit or other evidence, those facts may be a=
dmitted and the motion may be granted on the basis that plaintiff =E2=80=9C=
failed to carry the shifted burden of going forward.=E2=80=9D Hodge, 156 =
Ill. 2d at 116; Pleasant Hill Cemetery Ass=E2=80=99n, 2013 IL App (4th) 1=
20645, =C2=B6 21. - 7 - =C2=B6 20 The affirmative matter raised by Prefer=
red in its motion to dismiss, and supported with affidavits and depositio=
n testimony, is that it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff and it wa=
s not in a joint venture with Blackwell, and therefore, it could not be h=
eld liable for Blackwell=E2=80=99s disclosure of details regarding plaint=
iff=E2=80=99s hotel stay to Barrett or the assignment of Barrett to the r=
oom next to plaintiff without her prior consent. =C2=B6 21 Plaintiff argu=
es that Preferred can be held liable for the events that occurred at Blac=
kwell because either (1) Preferred was a member of a joint venture with B=
lackwell to operate the hotel or (2) Preferred voluntarily assumed a duty=
 of care to plaintiff. She contends that these theories of liability invo=
lve questions of fact that should have precluded dismissal of her claims.=
 =C2=B6 22 Joint Venture =C2=B6 23 A joint venture is an association of t=
wo or more persons to carry out a single enterprise for profit. O=E2=80=99=
Brien v. Cacciatore, 227 Ill. App. 3d 836, 843 (1992). Members of a joint=
 venture are vicariously liable for the joint venturers=E2=80=99 negligen=
t acts committed during the course of the venture. Hiatt v. Western Plast=
ics, Inc., 2014 IL App (2d) 140178, =C2=B6 72. Ordinarily whether a joint=
 venture exists is a question of fact; however, where there is no evidenc=
e to support the existence of a joint venture, its existence can be decid=
ed as a matter of law. Anderson v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc., 226 Ill. =
App. 3d 440, 444 (1992); Oliveira-Brooks v. Re/Max International, Inc., 3=
72 Ill. App. 3d 127, 134 (2007). =E2=80=9CThe existence of a joint ventur=
e is shown by allegations demonstrating (1) a community of interest in th=
e purpose of the joint association, (2) a right of each member to direct =
and govern the policy and conduct of the other members, and (3) a right t=
o joint control and management of the property used in the enterprise.=E2=
=80=9D Romanek v. Connelly, 324 Ill. App. 3d 393, 405 (2001) (citing Behr=
 v. Club Med, Inc., 190 Ill. App. 3d 396, 409 (1989)). A formal agreement=
 is not essential to establish a joint venture (Hiatt, 2014 IL App (2d) 1=
40178, =C2=B6 73), and its existence =E2=80=9Cmay be inferred from the fa=
cts and circumstances demonstrating that the parties in fact entered into=
 a joint venture=E2=80=9D (O=E2=80=99Brien, 227 Ill. App. 3d at 843). How=
ever, the most significant element to consider in determining whether a j=
oint venture exists is the intent of the parties. Thompson v. Hiter, 356 =
Ill. App. 3d 574, 582 (2005). =C2=B6 24 Plaintiff claims Preferred is lia=
ble for Blackwell=E2=80=99s actions because Preferred and OSU were engage=
d in a joint venture to operate Blackwell. Plaintiff argues Preferred and=
 OSU/Blackwell=E2=80=99s course of conduct created a joint venture, speci=
fically, Preferred=E2=80=99s control over the operations and policies of =
Blackwell and the sharing of reservation fees. We disagree and find that,=
 on the record before us, Preferred and OSU were nothing more than two se=
parate entities contracting with one another for a particular service fro=
m which each would derive their own individual profit. =C2=B6 25 The reco=
rd before us includes a written agreement between Preferred and OSU that =
governs their relationship regarding limited services for Blackwell. Unde=
r the agreement, Preferred provides OSU/Blackwell with marketing, sales, =
and reservation services in exchange for a fee. The agreement does not me=
ntion the creation of a joint venture or enterprise, and Preferred and OS=
U=E2=80=99s rights and obligations under the agreement are different from=
 one another. In fact, we found nothing in the agreement to infer that Pr=
eferred and OSU intended to operate Blackwell as a joint venture enterpri=
se. Furthermore, as we discuss below, plaintiff has not provided any =E2=80=
=9Caffidavits or other proof=E2=80=9D to refute Preferred=E2=80=99s affid=
avits and testimony - 8 - supporting the affirmative matter that Preferre=
d and OSU/Blackwell did nothing to create a joint venture either through =
the written agreement or through their conduct. =C2=B6 26 Common Interest=
 =C2=B6 27 As to the first element necessary to establish a joint venture=
, plaintiff contends that a community of interest is evidenced by Blackwe=
ll becoming a member of Preferred=E2=80=99s hotel network and Blackwell h=
aving access to Preferred=E2=80=99s iBook reservation system, which evide=
nces a joint venture relationship. We are not persuaded. Nothing in the p=
arties=E2=80=99 agreement or conduct, as developed from the discovery in =
the record, supports the conclusion that they shared a community of inter=
est in association with Blackwell. Certainly, both parties expected to be=
nefit from their contractual association, but this does not indicate the =
intention to create a joint venture to operate Blackwell. See Kaporovskiy=
 v. Grecian Delight Foods, Inc., 338 Ill. App. 3d 206, 212 (2003). In fac=
t, the agreement indicates that Preferred and Blackwell had two different=
 interests in doing business with one another. Preferred would allow Blac=
kwell the use of its reservation system so that Internet users could book=
 a hotel stay, and Preferred would be paid a fee for reserving a room usi=
ng its iBook service. This fee would be earned regardless of whether the =
reservation proved profitable to Blackwell. In return, Blackwell would se=
ll a room and generate revenue from that and other services. There is no =
evidence Preferred would financially benefit beyond the fee earned throug=
h iBook. Simply put, two distinct entities doing business together does n=
ot equate to the establishment of a joint venture. See id. =C2=B6 28 Righ=
t to Govern Blackwell=E2=80=99s Policy and Joint Control Over the Enterpr=
ise =C2=B6 29 Next, as to the second and third joint venture elements, pl=
aintiff suggests that Preferred=E2=80=99s contractual requirement that it=
s member hotels comply with its =E2=80=9CStandards of Excellence=E2=80=9D=
 equates to Preferred=E2=80=99s right to direct the conduct and policy of=
 Blackwell and exert control over its operation. Contractual agreements t=
hat require one party to perform or forbid performance of a particular ac=
t does not equate to control of management for the purpose of imposing a =
joint venture. Kaporovskiy, 338 Ill. App. 3d at 212 (limiting one contrac=
ting party from selling competing food products did not equate to =E2=80=9C=
control over property=E2=80=9D or policy); Barton v. Evanston Hospital, 1=
59 Ill. App. 3d 970, 974-75 (1987) (=E2=80=9Cmutuality of control=E2=80=9D=
 absent in a contractual relationship where doctor has discretion in pati=
ent treatment even though hospital supplied doctor with necessary equipme=
nt and personnel). =C2=B6 30 Here, the written agreement does not give Pr=
eferred any degree of joint control over the operation of Blackwell. Alth=
ough Preferred requires that its member hotels follow the =E2=80=9CStanda=
rds of Excellence,=E2=80=9D the evidence before us establishes that membe=
r hotels, including Blackwell, are not required to be in complete complia=
nce with Preferred=E2=80=99s standards and the hotels may interpret the s=
tandards and make adjustments or improvements at their discretion. Prefer=
red merely provides a list of standards that it wants its member hotels t=
o meet at a 70% or higher level, but Preferred does not actually engage i=
n any management or control over the hotel, its operations, or its staff.=
 According to Mr. Mastrandrea=E2=80=99s affidavit and deposition testimon=
y, which has not been refuted by plaintiff through =E2=80=9Caffidavits or=
 other proof,=E2=80=9D Preferred does not have any employees at Blackwell=
, Preferred does not and never had access to Blackwell=E2=80=99s guest li=
st or the assignment of hotel room numbers. Therefore, we find that Prefe=
rred and Blackwell did not have =E2=80=9Cmutuality of control=E2=80=9D ov=
er the hotel=E2=80=99s property and policies necessary to establish that =
element of a joint venture. - 9 - =C2=B6 31 Although plaintiff also conte=
nds that there was a sharing in the profits and the losses of Blackwell, =
there is no evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Preferred=E2=
=80=99s receiving a fee for its marketing and reservation services is not=
 akin to having a common interest and sharing profits in the operation of=
 Blackwell. Landers-Scelfo v. Corporate Office Systems, Inc., 356 Ill. Ap=
p. 3d 1060, 1066 (2005) (cooperation between two entities consisting of o=
ne handling of the payroll and human resources function of another compan=
y for a fee is insufficient as a matter of law to show a joint venture ex=
isted). There is nothing in the record to suggest that Preferred and Blac=
kwell were anything other than two separate entities doing business with =
one another for their separate financial benefit. More than a mere intere=
st in another entity=E2=80=99s success must be asserted to allege a joint=
 venture. Two businesses entering into a service agreement =E2=80=9Cseeki=
ng to mutually profit from it=E2=80=9D is not enough to turn a business r=
elationship into a joint venture sufficient to impose vicarious liability=
 on a contracting party. Kaporovskiy, 338 Ill. App. 3d at 212. While Pref=
erred may have hoped for Blackwell=E2=80=99s continued success so that it=
 could earn more fees through its booking and reservation services, this =
is not enough to support the legal conclusion that these entities were en=
gaged in a joint venture. Finally, after two years of discovery, a furthe=
r indication that no joint venture existed is the evidence that Preferred=
 would collect booking fees even if Blackwell operated at a financial los=
s. =C2=B6 32 In the absence of any one of the required elements, a joint =
venture cannot be found to exist in fact or in law. Powell v. Dean Foods =
Co., 2013 IL App (1st) 082513-B, =C2=B6 76. It is plaintiff=E2=80=99s bur=
den to show that she can support her claim that Preferred engaged in a jo=
int venture to operate Blackwell. Petry v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 51 =
Ill. App. 3d 1053, 1057 (1977). Beyond mere conclusory allegations, plain=
tiff has failed to support her legal conclusion or establish that a quest=
ion of fact exists as to the existence of a joint venture. Therefore, we =
affirm the ruling of the circuit court that Preferred did not have a duty=
 to plaintiff on this basis. =C2=B6 33 Voluntary Undertaking =C2=B6 34 Ne=
xt, plaintiff argues that whether Preferred voluntarily assumed a duty to=
 protect her privacy as a guest of Blackwell is a question of fact that p=
recludes dismissal under section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code. We disagree and=
 find that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Preferr=
ed voluntarily undertook a duty to protect the privacy of Blackwell=E2=80=
=99s guests. =C2=B6 35 Negligence cannot be established unless the defend=
ant owed the plaintiff a duty of care. LaFever v. Kemlite Co., 185 Ill. 2=
d 380, 388 (1998). Whether a duty of care exists is a question of law. Id=
.; Chelkova v. Southland Corp., 331 Ill. App. 3d 716, 722 (2002). Illinoi=
s courts have adopted section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (=
1965), which provides that one may be liable to a third person for the ne=
gligent performance of a voluntary undertaking. The relevant sections of =
section 324A of the Restatement provide as follows: =E2=80=9COne who unde=
rtakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another =
which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third pers=
on or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physica=
l harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect =
his undertaking, if: (a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increase=
s the risk of such harm, or (b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed =
by the other to the third person, or - 10 - (c) the harm is suffered beca=
use of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.=E2=
=80=9D Restatement (Second) of Torts =C2=A7 324A (1965). See Bell v. Huts=
ell, 2011 IL 110724, =C2=B6=C2=B6 12-14; Pippin v. Chicago Housing Author=
ity, 78 Ill. 2d 204 (1979). Under this theory, the scope of an assumed du=
ty =E2=80=9C =E2=80=98is limited to the extent of the undertaking=E2=80=99=
 =E2=80=9D and must be narrowly construed. Jablonski v. Ford Motor Co., 2=
011 IL 110096, =C2=B6 123 (quoting Bell, 2011 IL 110724, =C2=B6 12); Sikl=
as v. Ecker Center for Mental Health, Inc., 248 Ill. App. 3d 124, 131 (19=
93); Frye v. Medicare-Glaser Corp., 153 Ill. 2d 26, 32 (1992). To determi=
ne the extent of the voluntary undertaking we consider, on a case by case=
 basis, both the specific act undertaken and a reasonable assessment of i=
ts underlying purpose. Bourgonje v. Machev, 362 Ill. App. 3d 984 (2005). =
=C2=B6 36 Plaintiff argues that Preferred=E2=80=99s voluntary undertaking=
 was evidenced by several factors: (1) Preferred=E2=80=99s requirement th=
at its member hotels comply with its =E2=80=9CStandards of Excellence,=E2=
=80=9D which included two standards involving guest privacy; (2) Preferre=
d=E2=80=99s hiring of independent inspectors to review compliance with th=
ese standards; and (3) the appearance of Preferred=E2=80=99s signage in t=
he hotel informing hotel guests that the hotel is a member in Preferred=E2=
=80=99s network. Plaintiff contends that, because Preferred has two priva=
cy-related standards (that the hotel communicate the room rate and room n=
umber in writing at check-in and proof of identity must be shown before a=
 duplicate key is issued), the absence of a standard relating to disclosi=
ng guest identity and room number or placing a guest next to another on r=
equest is a breach of voluntary undertaking to protect a guest=E2=80=99s =
privacy. Further, plaintiff argues that Preferred negligently failed to p=
revent Blackwell from disclosing the identity of Andrews, the dates of he=
r stay, her r=0D
