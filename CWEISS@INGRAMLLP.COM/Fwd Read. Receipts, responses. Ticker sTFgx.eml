                    Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs
            programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in
            Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the
            bank’s high-frequency trading platform. <br>
                    He was convicted on two counts theft of trade
            secrets and transportation of stolen property and faces up
            to 10 years in prison.<br>
                <br>
            <br>
            During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the
            courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman’s
            proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about
            the firm’s high-frequency trading business, including that
            the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last
            year, less than 1 percent of Goldman’s total revenue of $45
            billion.<br>
            <br>
            On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal
            Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at
            Newark International airport and arrested him.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual
            United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him
            under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his
            sentencing, which is set for March 18.<br>

            Wall St. Programmer Guilty of Code Theft.<br>
            <br>
             United States Attorney Southern District of New York <br>
             <br>
             Manhattan U.S. Attorney PREET BHARARA said: "Protecting the
            proprietary information of America’s companies is critically
            important. Today’s sentence sends a clear message that
            professionals like Sergey Aleynikov who abuse their
            positions of trust to steal confidential business
            information from their employers will be prosecuted and
            punished."<br>
