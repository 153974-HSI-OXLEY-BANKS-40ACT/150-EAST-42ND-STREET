        (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall=

idence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than =
$50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the person=

riate United States district court for an order prohibiting that person f=
rom engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting th=
at person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the condu=
ct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition under this secti=
