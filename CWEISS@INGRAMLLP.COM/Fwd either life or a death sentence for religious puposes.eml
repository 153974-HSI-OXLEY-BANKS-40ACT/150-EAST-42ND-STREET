Lastly, I found the following statement equally reflective and to 
summarize the bullet points above from the same page:


“Management must be informed enough to make an effective contribution to 
system design, and information specialists (including systems analysts, 
accountants and operations researchers) must become more aware of 
managerial functions and needs so that, jointly, more effective MIS are 
developed.” (Adeoti, 326).
There is abundant evidence from numerous surveys conducted in developed 
countries, particularly in the UK and USA, that existing MIS, often 
using advanced computer equipment, have had relatively little success in 
providing management with the information it needs. Reasons discovered 
include the following:
• lack of management involvement with the design of the MIS;
• narrow or inappropriate emphasis of the computer system;
• undue concentration on low-level data processing applications 
particularly in the accounting area;
• poor appreciation by information specialists of management’s true 
information requirements and of organizational problems; and
• lack of top management support.
Generally, I agree with the principle of anonymity when it comes to 
research and data production. This was well introduced in the short form 
as referenced in Boulton:
“The privacy of data subjects needs to be protected.” (Boulton, 2)
