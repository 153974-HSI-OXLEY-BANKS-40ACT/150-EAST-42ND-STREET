Mr. Moore,=0D
   =0D
Judith Craig from the FDIC reached out and pointed out to Morgan Stanley =
as the brokerage arm with respect to this matter and in April. To no avai=
l, have not responded and continue in their dealings without concern, eve=
n write research reports for your competitor [BRK-B] while collecting pre=
miums for selling shares on a =E2=80=9Cpart time=E2=80=9D basis for you a=
nd yours.  =0D
       =0D
At this point, I don't expect the FDIC to review any of this directly - h=
owever I thank them for the guidance. The material party, as instructed b=
y Miss Craig, has failed to respond to any substantive request to myself =
and also to your own Auditor, as filed with the Securities and Exchange c=
ommission.=0D
     =0D
In a separate message, Mr. Moore (State Farm) did reach out to me and I a=
ttempted to schedule a call, I also emailed a conglomerate of State Farm=E2=
=80=99s advisors and representatives who have failed to return or respond=
 to my email, and despite the risks which are in fact a growing liability=
 of State Farm on a daily basis. I believe there is a certain "conflict o=
f interest", or a lack of understanding =E2=80=94 which unfortunately is =
something that may come back to the FDIC and without further clarificatio=
n from State Farm with respect to my position and during the period of my=
 residency. =0D
     =0D
I reached out to you in August of 2020 and solely based on what was repor=
ted in State Farm=E2=80=99s SEC filings and also with the New York City D=
epartment of Finance. This was to avoid a certain deterioration to the As=
sets held by State Farm, hence I must insist and warn you in advance =E2=80=
=94 that any gross neglect as seen in the posthaste filings under the adv=
isement of your brokers can and should be avoided.=0D
      =0D
In this instance, and without any =E2=80=9Cdemand=E2=80=9D for payment on=
 my part, on the basis of the "frequency of penalties which are known" in=
fractions by State Farm; historically are outweighed by the severity and =
consequences suffered by certain third party service providers =E2=80=93 =
namely in their unfair dealings, neglect, and ethical procedures.=0D
     =0D
The Violation of Privacy issues are known by the executives and directors=
 of Sullivan Properties LP, Morgan Stanley, notwithstanding the counselor=
s and affiliated companies of the Zucker Organization. It is important th=
at I speak with someone at State Farm to avoid a certain conflict, solely=
 on the basis of the contractual obligations filed with the New York Depa=
rtment of Finance. Those omissions I have discovered as reported to the S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission have created a paper trail of old and n=
ew investors that are invited, however bereft of the underlying risks pri=
or to purchasing subscriptions in your umbrella of Mutual Funds. =0D
     =0D
The extent of liability, and with my sole reliance on the provisions pres=
ented to Donald Zucker in writing on the 11th of May by =E2=80=9CState Fa=
rm Realty Mortgage LLC=E2=80=9D, as 'FIDELITY' of the State Farm Assuranc=
es Funds Trust =E2=80=94was and is reported by several Directors of both =
the =E2=80=9CInvestment Adviser=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CBroker Dealer=E2=80=
=9D and under the new Advisers Investment Trust. =0D
     =0D
This was executed under the former 'State Farm Assurances Funds Trust' in=
 fiscal year 2020 and as of current is NOT understood as a substantive ri=
sk, and is not reported. Which is the reason why it is important that you=
 make arrangements to speak with me as soon as possible. =0D
    =0D
This artifact (=E2=80=9C50074=E2=80=9D) was notarized and by its managing=
 agent =E2=80=9CState Farm Life Insurance Company=E2=80=9D, was filed whi=
le I resided at 111 Rear Sullivan Street, New York, NY, 10012. The degree=
 of negligence and understanding by those counselors is deplorable as see=
n in the proceedings initiated by Sullivan Properties LP, however I can a=
ssure you this again a good faith attempt by myself to help you understan=
d and explain to you where the omissions, obstruction, and conduct as exe=
mplified by Morgan Stanley=E2=80=99s involvement is also reciprocated in =
the dictum of Pricewaterhouse Coopers. =0D
    =0D
As it stands, you own the rights to the leases and rents for the six prop=
erties in question, and the covenants which are unique to each lot are co=
mplicated=E2=80=A6=0D
       =0D
The fiduciary roles and opinions of your advisory in this respect are tai=
nted, and also conflicted having on multiple occasions represented no con=
cern having reviewed the semi-annual and annual reports on behalf of Stat=
e Farm as their 'Promoters, and brokers'. Those statements filed with the=
 Securities and Exchange Commission are the only means whereby an investo=
rs confidence and reliance of the risks implied for both the 'State Farm =
Assurances Funds Trust' are represented by the omissions of PWC, however =
due to the =E2=80=9Cnon-responsive=E2=80=9D brokers, as promulgated and f=
iled under the new 'Advisers Investment Trust' by PWC. =0D
     =0D
As an obligations of State Farm and the terms of its prospectus while ope=
rating as the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust, in a transfer of the lea=
ses and rents for cash, represents a liability encumbered by several prop=
erties which were transferred to State Farm in May of 2020. The extent of=
 the liability, however, is beyond the scope of your understanding for mo=
ral and ethical consideration =E2=80=93 should not be neglected by State =
Farm in this respect and on behalf of its investors.=0D
      =0D
I would recommend that you make arrangements to speak with me, independen=
t of the ZUCKERS or their counselors, and to avoid any further =E2=80=9Cc=
onflicted advisement=E2=80=9D. If you feel comfortable holding the implie=
d liabilities without speaking with me, I respect your decision and can o=
nly wish the best for you and yours in the future. =0D
      =0D
I can assure you the underlying risks were obstructed by the counselors i=
n the matter of 153974/2020; even having said this, I would implore that =
you make arrangements to discuss this matter with me directly at 646-256-=
3609, or via email at your earliest possible convenience. =0D
     =0D
This is not a letter of demand by any means, and a good faith attempt on =
my own time to provide you with an unbiased opinion and a =E2=80=9Cnon-co=
nflicting=E2=80=9D opinion to assist you. =0D
     =0D

Thank you again for your guidance in this matter Judith, I will get back =
to you, and hopefully after speaking with Mr. Moore and State Farm in the=
 coming week. =0D
           =0D
Please enjoy your weekends, and also understand that I will help you to c=
lear the risk of your involvement(s) with matters which pertain to item 5=
0074, and more importantly =E2=80=94 without a certain deluge of informat=
