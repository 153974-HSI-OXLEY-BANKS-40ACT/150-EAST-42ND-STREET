> STATEMENT OF GARY GENSLER, CHAIRMAN, COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
>                            COMMISSION
>
>     Mr. Gensler. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking
> Member Shelby, and Members of this Committee. I thank you for
> inviting me here today. I am pleased to testify on behalf of
> the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and I also thank my
> fellow Commissioners and all of the staff at the CFTC for their
> hard work and commitment in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. I
> am pleased to testify along with my fellow regulators Chairman
> Schapiro and Governor Tarullo, who I had the honor to be
> announced with by then President-elect Obama 2\1/2\ years ago,
> so we get to be together, and Assistant Secretary Mary Miller.
> We have known each other now for about 15 years, so it is great
> to be here together.
>     The CFTC is working very closely with the SEC, the Federal
> Reserve, and other regulators in the U.S. and overseas. We are
> coordinating and consulting with international regulators to
> harmonize oversight of the swaps market, and we have received
> thousands of comments today both before we have made proposals
> and after we have made proposals. At this point in the process,
> the CFTC has proposed rules in 29 of the 31 areas that the
> Dodd-Frank Act required us to do so, including proposing rules
> this morning on margin, which, of course, as well the Federal
> Reserve and other prudential regulators took up.
>     Consistent with what Congress did in exempting nonfinancial
> end users from clearing, the proposed rule would not require
> margin to be paid or collected on transactions involving
> nonfinancial end users hedging or mitigating commercial risk.
>     Over the next several weeks, it is our goal to largely
> complete the mosaic of proposed rules by proposing rules
> relating to capital as well as the joint product definition
> rule along with the SEC and segregation for cleared swaps. And
> it is our goal to try to complete that in the next several
> weeks.
>     One component that we have asked the public about is
> phasing of implementation. We have not moved to any final rules
> yet. The whole mosaic will be out there, but implementation is
> very important. The SEC and the CFTC actually earlier today
> jointly announced that we would ask the public more on this. We
> have asked on every one of our rules, but we want to do it in a
> coordinated way. So early in May we are going to hold 2 days of
> public roundtables to hear about effective dates and
> implementation schedules, which compliance should come later,
> which may be earlier, how it should be phased, whether by asset
> class, by market participant, or by other characteristics.
>     We have also put a dedicated comment file up on our Web
> site today so that people can comment on this very important
> issue.
>     We will be considering final rules only after staff can
> analyze, summarize, and consider comments, after the
> Commissioners themselves can provide feedback, and after we can
> consult with other regulators not only here but around the
> globe.
>     Before I conclude, I just want to briefly talk about
> resources. I appreciate any and all that this Committee did now
> that we are going to move forward and get some breathing room
> and certainty in 2011 funding. But the CFTC is a good
> investment, and it has been asked to take on a much more
> significant role than just overseeing the futures marketplace.
> The futures marketplace is about $40 trillion in notional size,
> maybe about $2.50 to $3 in futures for every dollar in the
> economy. But the swaps marketplace that we have been asked to
> oversee is $300 trillion in size here in the U.S. Give or take,
> $20 of swaps for every dollar in the economy. We share that
> role with the SEC, but clearly it is 7 times the futures
> marketplace.
>     We are a good investment, even with what it just looks like
> Congress will be recommending this week, $202 million. It is
> dwarfed by the size of the financial industry itself, which is
> measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues. So
> the President has put forward a plan for us at $308 million
> next year. I look forward to working with this Committee and
> the appropriators on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses
> to see how we can assure that we have the resources to fulfill
> the mission.
>     Thank you.
>     Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Gensler.

>  STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF
>                    THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
>
>     Mr. Tarullo. Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, and other
> Members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to
> provide the Federal Reserve Board's views on the implementation
> of Title VII of Dodd-Frank. The Board's responsibilities fall
> into three broad areas. The first relates to coordination and
> consultation with other authorities, both domestic and foreign.
>     As to domestic consultation, Dodd-Frank requires that the
> CFTC and the SEC consult with the Board on rules to implement
> Title VII. In providing comments to the two market regulators,
> we have tried to bring to bear our experience from supervising
> dealers and market infrastructures and our familiarity with
> markets and data sources.
>     There are also very important international coordination
> activities related to derivatives. Most prominently, the Group
> of 20, or G-20 leaders, sometime ago established commitments
> related to reform of the OTC derivatives market that would form
> a broadly consistent international regulatory approach. In an
> effort to implement the various portions of that commitment,
> the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems is working with
> the International Organization of Securities Commissions to
> update international standards for systemically important
> clearing systems, including central counterparties that clear
> derivatives instruments, and trade repositories.
>     Even before the G-20 leaders initiative, the Basel
> Committee on Banking Supervision had established capital
> standards for derivatives. More recently, the committee has
> strengthened those standards and has created leverage and
> liquidity standards which will be applicable to them.
>     The goal of all of these efforts should be a level playing
> field that will promote both financial stability and fair
> competitive conditions to the fullest extent possible. And I
> think for all of the agencies represented here today, the
> pursuit of this end is going to need to remain a priority for
> some time.
>     The second task given to the Federal Reserve under Title
> VII relates to the strengthening of infrastructure. Central
> counterparties are given an expanded role in the clearing and
> settlement of swap and security-based swap transactions. If
> properly designed, managed, and overseen, central
> counterparties offer an important tool for managing
> counterparty credit risk, and thus reducing risk to market
> participants and to the financial system.
>     Title VII of the act complements the role of central
> clearing by heightening supervisory oversight of systemically
> important financial market utilities. This heightened oversight
> is important because financial market utilities such as central
> counterparties concentrate risk and thus have the potential to
> transmit shocks throughout the financial markets.
>     As part of Title VIII, the Board was given new authority to
> provide emergency collateralized liquidity in unusual and
> exigent circumstances to systemically important financial
> market utilities. We are at present carefully considering how
> to implement this provision in a manner that protects taxpayers
> and limits the rise in moral hazard.
>     The third task committed to the Board by Dodd-Frank is that
> of supervision. Capital and margin requirements are central to
> the prudential regulation of financial institutions active in
> derivatives markets as well as to the internal risk management
> processes of those firms. The major rulemaking responsibility
> of the Board and the other prudential regulators is to adopt
> capital and margin regulations for the noncleared swaps of
> banks and other prudentially regulated entities that are swap
> dealers or major swap participants.
>     The Board and the other U.S. banking agencies played an
> active role in developing the enhanced capital leverage and
> liquidity regime that I mentioned before. These requirements
> will strengthen the prudential framework for OTC derivatives by
> increasing risk-based capital and leverage requirements and
> requiring banking firms to hold an additional buffer of high-
> quality liquid assets to address potential liquidity needs
> resulting from their derivatives portfolios.
>     The statute also requires the prudential regulators to
> adopt rules imposing initial and variation margins on
> noncleared swaps to which swap dealers or major swap
> participants that they supervise are a party.
>     The statute directs that these margin requirements be risk-
> based. In accordance with the statutory instruction, the Board
> and other prudential regulators proposed to implement the
> margin provisions in a way that recognizes the low systemic
> risk posed by most end users. The proposed rule would not
> specify a minimum margin requirement. Rather, it would allow a
> banking organization that is a dealer or major participant to
> establish a threshold based on a credit exposure limit that is
> approved and monitored as a part of the normal credit approval
> process, below which the end user would not have to post
> margin.
>     Finally, I would note that the proposed regulation provides
> that the margin requirement should be applied only to contracts
> entered into after the new requirement becomes effective.
>     Thank you for your attention.
>     Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Governor Tarullo.
>     Assistant Secretary Miller, please proceed.

> STATEMENT OF MARY J. MILLER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FINANCIAL
>               MARKETS, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
>
>     Ms. Miller. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and
> Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify
> today about Treasury's role in implementing Dodd-Frank's
> derivatives provisions.
>     As you know, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into
> law almost 9 months ago. The act established a framework for
> the country to build a stronger, safer, and more competitive
> financial system. It creates safeguards to protect consumers
> and investors, end taxpayer bailouts, and improve the
> transparency, efficiency, and liquidity of U.S. markets. The
> derivatives provisions are a critical part of that framework,
> and the Administration strongly supports them. Dodd-Frank's
> derivatives provisions will shed light on a market that
> previously operated in the shadows. Central clearing, trade
> execution, and reporting requirements and business conduct
> standards will provide substantial benefits. The work that the
> Administration is undertaking in partnership with our
> colleagues at the CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve Board is vital
> in preventing the harmful buildup of risk that contributed so
> greatly to the financial crisis in 2008.
>     As other Treasury officials have previously testified,
> several broad principles guide our implementation efforts.
> First, we are moving quickly to meet the statute's deadlines,
> but we are also moving carefully to make sure that as we
> implement the act we get it right.
>     Second, we are bringing transparency to the process so that
> as many stakeholders as possible have a seat at the table, the
> American people know who is at that table, and anyone who wants
> to provide input on requests for comment and proposed
> rulemakings can do so.
>     We are creating a more coordinated regulatory process. The
> Financial Stability Oversight Council is playing a key role by
> bringing together the financial regulatory agencies to help
> develop consistent and comparable regulations and supervisory
> regimes.
>     Fourth, we are building a level playing field by setting
> high standards in the United States and working diligently with
> our international counterparts to follow our lead.
>     Fifth, we are crafting rules of the road that will provide
> U.S. investors and institutions the conditions they need to
> invest capital, develop innovative products, and compete
> globally.
>     Finally, we are committed to regularly keeping Congress
> informed about our progress. The Treasury Secretary has
> specific statutory responsibilities with respect to derivatives
> implementation and also has other responsibilities in his
> capacity as the Chairman of the FSOC.
>     Starting with the specific, Congress gave the Secretary the
> authority to determine whether foreign exchange swaps and
> forwards should be exempt from the definition of swap in the
> Commodity Exchange Act. The Secretary must consider the
> statutory factors set forth by the Dodd-Frank Act, including
> the impact regulating FX swaps and forwards swaps under the CEA
> would have on systemic risk and financial stability; the
> existing regulatory regime and supervision of FX swaps and
> forward participants; and, finally, whether an exemption could
> lead to evasion of other regulatory requirements.
>     We published a request for comments to solicit public input
> on a wide range of issues relating to a potential exemption. We
> received 30 comments in response, and Treasury staff has also
> conducted an independent analysis, including extensive
> discussions with a range of interested parties.
>     We know that market participants, other stakeholders, and
> the Committee are closely following this issue. Regardless of
> the decision the Secretary makes, market participants need to
> be able to prepare for it. While we intend to move
> expeditiously, it is also critical that we take enough time to
> make the right decision for the safety and soundness of the
> markets.
>     The Secretary also has derivatives implementation
> responsibilities in his capacity as FSOC Chairman. The FSOC
> recently approved the publication of a Notice of Proposed
> Rulemaking regarding the designation of systemically important
> financial market utilities. FMUs support and facilitate the
> transfer, clearing, and settlement of financial transactions,
> and they form a critical part of the Nation's financial
> infrastructure. The notice was published on March 28th and will
> be open for comments for 60 days.
>     One final area I would like to touch on is the importance
> of comparable international standards, including derivatives
> oversight. The United States will set high standards, but
> today's financial system is highly interconnected, mobile, and
> global. We must work not only to protect the competitiveness of
> U.S. financial markets but also to ensure that the reforms we
> implement here are not undermined by lax standards elsewhere.
>     We will continue to work at home and abroad to build a
> regulatory framework for derivatives that will help our
> financial system become safer and sounder and a platform on
> which we can build strong financial markets that will fuel our
> economic growth.
>     Thank you.
>     Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Miller. I
> will start off the questions. Thanks for your testimony.
>     I will remind my colleagues that we will keep the record
> open for statements, questions, and any other material you
> would like to submit. As we begin questioning the witnesses, I
> will put 5 minutes on the clock for each Member's questions.
>     Chairman Schapiro and Chairman Gensler, how do you plan to
> reconcile the different SEC and CFTC proposed rulemakings
> governing swap execution facilities, real time reporting, block
> trades, and other infrastructure consistent with Dodd-Frank's
> requirement to assure regulatory consistency and comparability
> and treat functionally or economically similar products or
> entities in a similar manner?
>     Ms. Schapiro. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to start. We
> are very, very focused, obviously, on the issues surrounding
> the fact that in a number of areas, and you just articulated
> several of them, we do have differences in our rule sets
> between the SEC and the CFTC. Some of those differences may
> actually be necessitated by the fact that the markets, while
> they are both derivatives markets, the products may trade
> differently, have different liquidity characteristics, and for
> that reason, some differences may actually be appropriate in
> order to continue to foster the development of these markets.
> But we have asked for comment on whether our understanding in
> that regard is correct.
>     But I would also say that we are continuing to work
> extremely closely together through the proposing stage, and now
> that for a number of rules comment periods have closed, we were
> able to review the comments that have come in on our proposals
> as well as those that have come in on the CFTC's proposals
> where they have gone in a slightly different direction and we
> are very committed to continuing to work through those
> differences, and if they are not grounded in very good market
> structure reasons because of the nature of the products, trying
> to get them as consistent as we possibly can.
>     Where we have proposed after the CFTC, I would just add, on
> some rules, we have actually sought explicitly to get comment
> on their approach to see if that might be a better way to go
> forward. So in a number of areas where we do have differences,
> I believe because we are still at the proposing stage and not
> at the adopting stage, we will be able to work through many of
> those differences. And then, of course, through implementation,
> it may be necessary for either or both of us to engage in some
> interpretation of our rules in order to ease implementation and
> make them consistent.
>     Mr. Gensler. I will keep it brief. I agree with what
> Chairman Schapiro said. It is a lot of consultation and
> coordination. It is also in the context of there are some
> differences between the futures marketplace and the securities
> marketplace that either have existed in statute or in rules or
> just in market practice for decades, and so we are trying to be
> as close as we can between swaps and securities-based swaps
> while also not creating some regulatory arbitrage and undercut,
> for instance, in our case, a futures marketplace that has
> worked with a great deal of transparency and low risk to the
> American public, and not undercut that marketplace through some
> differences, as well. And I suspect the same issues on your
> side.
>     Ms. Schapiro. If I could just add, it is critically
> important to us, as well, that because securities-based swaps
> can be economic equivalents to equity positions, that we want
> to make sure that we do not create, while we are trying to be
> more and more synched up with the swaps markets, between the
> security-based swaps and swaps markets, that we are not
> creating great distance between the security-based swap markets
> and the equity markets, as well.
>     Chairman Johnson. Assistant Secretary Miller and Governor
> Tarullo, how are Treasury and the Fed working to harmonize
> international derivatives regulations through the G-20 and the
> Financial Stability Board, especially given the different
> international time frames for moving ahead on new rules? How
> are your efforts in this area being coordinated with the CFTC
> and the SEC to be sure that requirements for capital and other
> rules are both appropriate and consistent?
>     Ms. Miller. Well, we are following this very closely,
> because as I said, we are very interested in having good
> harmonization globally on these rules. So in many settings,
> Treasury staff are engaging with their counterparts in
> different international groups. There are a number of working
> groups on derivatives that are occurring through the Financial
> Stability Board in Europe. We are also interested in things
> that are going on in Asia. So we are following both the
> rulemaking process in the U.S. and we are engaging regularly
> with our counterparts in other countries.
>     Mr. Tarullo. Mr. Chairman, let me add a couple of thoughts
> there. As you can tell from the testimony today, the other
> rulemakings that the SEC and the CFTC have ongoing, dealing
> with the international equivalents of Title VII and Title VIII,
> are going to implicate a number of different regulatory
> authorities in other jurisdictions.
>     So I think what was looked for by the G-20 was a framework
> of agreement or commitment on a set of goals that would then be
> pursued in the various appropriate international bodies. What
> we have got now, I think, is a good bit of very productive work
> on efforts to get agreement on central counterparties, on
> electronic trading, on transparency for those counterparties,
> on risk management standards. That is being done, I think,
> through a lot of cooperation among agencies, but in particular,
> the Fed and the SEC, because, in fact, we have got a Reserve
> Bank President and a Commissioner of the SEC who are chairing
> the key international committees on this point--President
> Dudley of the New York Fed and Commissioner Casey of the SEC.
>     On capital, as I said in my prepared remarks, the Basel
> Committee on Banking Supervision has a set of capital
> requirements for derivatives in a part of its overall
> internationally recognized capital standards. They have been
> updated to take account of what was learned during the crisis,
> but they are already agreed among all the Basel Committee
> members, which constitutes not just the G-20 but some
> additional countries beyond the G-20.
>     I think the one area where we probably need some more work
> now is on margins for noncleared derivatives and noncleared
> swaps. I think the fact that we, the prudential regulators and
> the market regulators are now moving toward a proposal for the
> U.S. is going to enable us to have a clear, coherent, and
> unified position internationally to try to move along some
> other countries which are actively, or in some cases not so
> actively, considering putting these requirements in place.
>     With respect to coordination, I think it has been very
> good. As you can tell from just my recitation of the different
> committees, we need to have everybody involved because there
> are different expertises here, and from all accounts that I get
> from our staff and directly from talking to principals at other
> agencies, I think this is one area where the convergence of
> views and the cooperation among U.S. agencies has been quite
> good.
>     Chairman Johnson. Senator Shelby.
>     Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>     Assistant Secretary Miller, on our second panel today, we
> will hear from the Treasurer of FMC, a large manufacturing
> company here in the U.S., who has grave concerns, according to
> his testimony, about the excessive regulations mandated by
> Dodd-Frank. His testimony indicates that these regulations will
> increase operating costs, making it more difficult for his
> company to both create jobs and to manage risk. Do you believe
> that FMC Manufacturing Company, the end user, is the type of
> company that should be regulated under Dodd-Frank, and does
> Treasury have any concerns about the potential consequences of
> Dodd-Frank derivatives regulation on job creation? Have you
> done any work in this area?
>     Ms. Miller. OK. Thank you for the question. We have heard a
> great deal from end users, nonfinancial and financial in the
> markets, and I think that there is sufficient flexibility in
> the Dodd-Frank legislation to work with a company like FMC in
> terms of providing flexibility under derivatives regulation.
>     Senator Shelby. In other words, a company that is an end
> user that is managing risk but not in the pure financial
> speculation, is that right?
>     Ms. Miller. Yes. We have not done any specific work on the
> economic impact on job creation of this particular title.
>     Senator Shelby. Will you do some research, have Treasury do
> some research into that area?
>     Ms. Miller. Well, we have worked----
>     Senator Shelby. Because this could have ramifications for
> creating jobs, could it not, if it is----
>     Ms. Miller. There were many studies mandated by Dodd-Frank
> and we have been diligently delivering the work that has been
> delivered under the statute. So we have put out quite a bit on
> the financial market ramifications.
>     Senator Shelby. Foreign exchange swaps and another area.
> Treasury is charged with determining whether foreign exchange
> swaps and forwards should be subject to extensive Government
> regulation. In your testimony today, you stated that, quote--I
> will quote you--``we want to move expeditiously with respect to
> making the determination that the treatment of foreign
> exchange--about the treatment of foreign exchange and swaps.''
> When will Treasury make its determination, in your judgment?
>     Ms. Miller. So I regret that I do not have that decision to
> give you today for the hearing. I think we are very close. We
> have been working on that----
>     Senator Shelby. Would you furnish that for the record and
> the other Committee Members when you get it?
>     Ms. Miller. We absolutely will, and we would be delighted
> to come up and brief you on our decision either way.
>     Senator Shelby. Are you at Treasury aware of any market
> failure in the foreign exchange market that would justify
> further regulation?
>     Ms. Miller. There are many parts of the foreign exchange
> market. The FX swaps and forwards part that you just mentioned
> is one part of the foreign exchange market----
>     Senator Shelby. Are you aware of any failures in that area
> that would justify further regulation?
>     Ms. Miller. I think there are many parts of that market
> that were under severe stress during the financial crisis and
> some parts of it will be subject to Dodd-Frank regulation.
>     Senator Shelby. To your knowledge, were any of the areas in
> derivatives where you are managing risk and you are an end user
> under extreme stress? I do not know of any.
>     Ms. Miller. I would be happy to reply to that question with
> further research if you want specific examples----
>     Senator Shelby. Will you do that for the record?
>     Ms. Miller. Sure.
>     Senator Shelby. OK. Governor Tarullo, central
> clearinghouses is an area which is very important. Last week,
> Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve gave a speech about
> the importance of properly regulating clearinghouses. He noted
> that one of the reasons that clearinghouses have not had
> trouble to date is, quote, ``good luck.'' We cannot always
> count on good luck, as you know. Beyond relying on luck, what
> steps can we take, or can you take, to ensure that taxpayers
> are never called upon to bail out clearinghouses because that
> was a concern of a lot of us when we were debating the Dodd-
> Frank legislation, as you will recall.
>     Mr. Tarullo. Right. I do recall your questions on that
> topic, Senator, a year or two ago. So with respect to the
> central clearing parties that are designated as systemically
> important, there will be oversight by the appropriate market
> regulator, but the Federal Reserve has a role to play there as
> well. We have a consultative role. We hope to be involved in
> the exams, bringing to bear, if I can put it this way, a
> supervisory or prudential supervisory perspective on these
> institutions. So we would hope that they will all be subject to
> strong prudential requirements for credit risk, strong
> liquidity buffers----
>     Senator Shelby. What does ``hope'' mean? Now, you said you
> would hope----
>     Mr. Tarullo. The mechanism here is one--the primary
> regulators are the market regulators.
>     Senator Shelby. I know. We know.
>     Mr. Tarullo. We have a consultative role----
>     Senator Shelby. Oversight role.
>     Mr. Tarullo. We have an oversight role, that is correct,
> and in that capacity, I think we will hope to contribute to the
> perspective on the supervision of these organizations. I
> suspect that there will be convergence among the agencies on
> the kind of standards that are important, and, as I said, I
> think we are going to draw on our experience not just with
> market entities, which we do have, but also supervising from a
> prudential point of view, looking to safety and soundness and
> not simply market operations.
>     Senator Shelby. In the same type area, the United Kingdom's
> Financial Services Authority wrote a comment letter in response
> to a rule proposed by the CFTC on risk management requirements
> for clearinghouses. The FSA, the United Kingdom's Financial
> Services Authority, warned the CFTC that lax eligibility
> requirements for firms to be members of clearinghouses could
> create new risk to the financial system. Do you agree with
> FSA's comments, or are you concerned about that, too?
>     Mr. Tarullo. Senator, I have not seen the FSA comment on
> the proposed CFTC rule. I would say that an effective member
> qualification and default set of standards is very important to
> the integrity of any central clearing party.
>     Senator Shelby. Should not you or we, we altogether, should
> not we do everything we possibly can do to ensure that there is
> no bailout of a clearinghouse?
>     Mr. Tarullo. Absolutely, Senator. I think that is why we
> all, everybody up there, everybody at the table here, share an
> interest in having rigorous and effectively enforced standards
> for the central clearing parties.
>     Senator Shelby. Can I get Chairman Gensler's comments on
> that, because that is in his area.
>     Mr. Gensler. It is a big yes. I think that central
> clearinghouses need robust oversight. I view it as a
> partnership with the Federal Reserve, even we might be the
> front line and, of course, the SEC has their clearinghouses, as

>     Senator Corker. That is right. That is right.

>     Senator Corker. So on the large block trades, they are

>     Mr. Gensler. They are excluded.

>     Senator Corker. OK.
>     Mr. Gensler. Yes.

>     Mr. Gensler. Well, I am glad you asked. Congress said that

>     Senator Corker. Right.

>     Senator Corker. So that is a yes?
>     Mr. Gensler. I think it is a yes----
>     Senator Corker. I think there are a lot of concerns because

>     Mr. Gensler. Senator, I think you asked about equities and

>     In addition to my role in FMC Corporation, I am also
> president of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers.
> FMC and NACT are together members of the Coalition for
> Derivatives End Users, representing thousands of companies
> across the country that employ derivatives to manage day-to-day
> business risk. I would like to express my gratitude to you, Mr.
> Chairman, and to Ranking Member Shelby, for your bipartisan

> Chairman Johnson for your work last week with the other
> Committee Chairmen in support of end user margin exemption. We

> effective date for the proposed regulations, and I thank you,
> Senator Toomey, and Ranking Member Shelby for your kind words
> about FMC Corporation and your care and interest for
> manufacturing companies of which we are a proud one.
>     In fact, FMC Corporation was founded almost 130 years ago
> to provide spray equipment to farmers. Today, in addition
> making agricultural chemicals that farmers apply to protect
> their crops, our 5,000 employees have worked hard to make FMC a
> leading manufacturer and marketer of a whole range of
> agricultural, specialty, and industrial chemicals. We have
> achieved this longevity by continually responding to our
> customers' needs with the right chemistry delivered at the
> right price. This year marks our 80th anniversary of listing on
> the New York Stock Exchange. I had the valuable experience on a
> newer financial market, one that we have been discussing today.
> I had the opportunity to negotiate and execute some of the very
> first derivatives--currency swaps--going back to 1984. I have
> seen the derivatives market grow from its inception in the mid-
> 1980s to its current size by adapting and responding to market
> participants' needs.
>     We support this Committee's efforts to redress the problems
> with derivatives experienced during the financial crisis in
> 2008, but I want to assure you that FMC and other end users
> were not and are not engaging in risky speculative derivatives
> transactions. We use over-the-counter derivatives to hedge
> risks in our business activity. We are offsetting risks, not
> creating new ones.
>     FMC is the world's largest producer of natural soda ash,
> the principal input in glass manufacturing, and we are one of
> the largest employers in the State of Wyoming. We can mine and
> refine soda ash products in southwestern Wyoming, ship them to
> South Asia, and deliver them at a lower cost and with higher
> quality than competing Chinese producers. We have achieved this
> export success in part because of the derivatives we enter into
> to hedge natural gas prices. These derivatives are done with
> several banks, all of which are also supporting FMC through
> their provision of almost $1 billion of committed credit. Our
> banks do not require FMC to post cash margin, but they take
> this risk into account as they price the transaction with us.
> This structure gives us certainty so that we never have to post
> cash margin while the derivative is outstanding.
>     But the current system, where end users and their
> counterparties decide collaboratively whether and how margins
> should apply is changing. Today the FDIC proposed a rule that
> could in the future subject end users to margin requirements.
> While we are still reviewing the details, it appears
> regulators, not market participants, will now determine how
> margin will be set. Regulators will have the final say over how
> much cash an end user will have to divert to a margin account
> where it will sit unavailable for productive uses.
>     In our world of finite limits and financial constraints,
> posting cash margin would be a direct dollar-for-dollar
> subtraction from funds that we would otherwise use to expand
> our plants, build inventory to support higher sales, conduct
> research and development activities, and ultimately sustain and
> grow jobs.
>     In fact, a coalition survey of derivative end users
> extrapolated the effects of margin requirements across the S&P
> 500, of which FMC is also a member, to predict the consequent
> loss of 100,000 to 120,000 jobs, depending on these proposed
> thresholds. The effect on the many thousands of end users
> beyond the S&P 500 would be proportionately greater.
>     Although I have focused here on margin, end users are also

> Government bonds. This phone-based trading model is how the OTC

>     In the late 1990s, due to technological advances and the

> electronic Request for Quote marketplace for U.S. Treasury
> securities. Our RFQ model gave clients the ability to run an

> automate a manual trading process.
>     Tradeweb's RFQ marketplace for U.S. Government bonds helped
> transform a phone-based and largely opaque Government bond

> each day with 1,000 institutional clients located in every
> financial center around the world. Among all of our platforms
> and products, the daily volume on Tradeweb is in excess of $300
> billion per day.
>     Tradeweb supports the goals of Dodd-Frank, which we believe
> to be enhanced transparency and reduction of systemic risk.
> However, it is vitally important to understand and give due
> consideration to the needs of market participants in
> promulgating rules for implementing Title VII. The aim must be
> to achieve the goals of the act without materially disrupting
> the market and the liquidity it provides to end users.
>     Market participants need confidence to participate in these
> markets, and if careful consideration is not given to what the
> rules say, we fear that this confidence could be materially
> shaken.
>     The key for achieving the policy objectives for SEFs is to
> provide for flexibility in the way market participants can
> interact and trade swaps. Creating arbitrary or artificially
> prescriptive limitations on the manner in which market
> participants interact and trade could result in liquidity
> drying up, increased costs to trade swaps, and market
> participants seeking other, less efficient ways to manage their
> risk.
>     Finally, there has been a great deal of discussion recently

                        TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011

                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 2:45 p.m., in room SD-538, Dirksen=20
Senate Office Building, Hon. Tim Johnson, Chairman of the=20
Committee, presiding.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN TIM JOHNSON

    Chairman Johnson. I would like to call this hearing to=20
order. Due to the length of this afternoon&#39;s hearing, we will=20
limit opening statements today to myself and Ranking Member=20
Shelby, and I would ask the other Members of the Committee to=20
please submit their opening statements for the record.
    Today we will review the implementation of the new=20
regulatory framework for the OTC derivatives market required by=20
the Dodd-Frank Act. This is our Committee&#39;s first oversight=20
hearing on this issue since the passage of Dodd-Frank. While I=20
know there are many other issues that Senators may like to=20
raise with the regulators before us today, we should focus our=20
questions on the subject of this hearing.
    The Dodd-Frank Act brings needed transparency and=20
accountability to our derivatives market and addresses problems=20
that greatly exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis. I commend=20
all of the regulators here today and their staffs for their=20
extraordinary work and long hours they have dedicated to these=20
important reforms.
    Putting in a new framework to regulate the vast $600=20
trillion swaps market in this age of instantaneous global=20
capital movement is an enormously complicated task that demands=20
close cooperation with international regulators. We must create=20
new rules of the road to ensure that our financial markets=20
remain the envy of the world. Our regulators should follow=20
congressional intent to craft rules that are based on relevant=20
data that reflect the unique structure of the swaps market=20
while avoiding rulemaking for political expediency, and ask=20
Chairman Gensler and Chairman Schapiro and all our regulators=20
to work carefully to do what is necessary to get this right.
    This effort will require strong coordination both within=20
and among regulators to review the full set of final rules in a=20
holistic way before they are finalized. The regulators must=20
also integrate meaningful public input into this review. I urge=20
our regulators to work together to craft a streamlined,=20
harmonized set of workable rules that protect the ability to=20
hedge risks in a cost-effective manner and minimize unintended=20
consequences that could send American jobs overseas.
    With that, I turn to Senator Shelby.

             STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY

    Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Today the Committee will examine the implementation of the=20
Dodd-Frank Act&#39;s new derivatives regulatory scheme. There is=20
particular need for oversight in this area because Dodd-Frank=20
has needlessly, I believe, created widespread uncertainty about=20
the regulation of derivatives and threatens to impose huge=20
costs on Main Street businesses as well as on our overall=20
economy.
    The irony is that the proponents of Dodd-Frank told us that=20
the new law would bring certainty to the market and stimulate=20
economic growth. Instead, Dodd-Frank has set in motion a=20
massive regulatory rulemaking process that is on an unrealistic=20
timetable. Predictably, the result has been regulatory=20
confusion and market uncertainty.
    Regulators are hastily proposing rules to meet the=20
extremely short deadlines without fully considering either=20
their economic impact or how they interact with the rules=20
proposed by other regulators. Meanwhile, market participants=20
are scrambling to understand how the numerous and complicated=20
rules will impact their businesses. In fact, they have filed=20
thousands of comments on the proposed rules.
    The comments reveal the gravity of their concerns as well=20
as their confusion about how the rules will work in practice.=20
This process is a direct result of the poorly conceived=20
regulatory structure created by the Dodd-Frank legislation.=20
Although numerous studies have recommended consolidating our=20
financial regulators, Dodd-Frank actually dispersed authority=20
for derivatives regulation. Unfortunately, the danger of having=20
multiple regulators involved is a process marked by disorder=20
and confusion.
    For example, although regulators have proposed numerous new=20
rules for derivatives, the CFTC and the SEC have still not=20
proposed rules that clarify the definition of a swap. This=20
omission alone has had serious ramifications for our markets=20
and the implementation process. After all, if regulators do not=20
know what the definition of a swap is, how can they finalize=20
their own rules governing swap dealers or major swap=20
participants since it is unclear exactly who is covered by=20
these rules? And if market participants do not know if they=20
will be classified as a swap dealer or a major swap=20
participant, how can they be expected to know when to submit=20
comments?
    This is just one example of how Dodd-Frank has created a=20
confused derivatives rulemaking process that is not proceeding=20
in a logical order and creates significant uncertainty in our=20
markets.
    The regulatory process is further hampered by the fact that=20
the Dodd-Frank Act was so poorly drafted. Here is just one=20
example, a simple example that illustrates my point.
    One of the first Dodd-Frank rules promulgated by the CFTC=20
was an interim final rule for ``reporting pre-enactment swap=20
transactions.&#39;&#39; The stated purpose of the rule is to reconcile=20
two conflicted Dodd-Frank provisions: Sections 723 and 729.
    The CFTC rule proposal specifically states, and I will=20
quote, ``The inconsistencies between these two reporting=20
provisions must be reconciled in order to eliminate uncertainty=20
with respect to the actual reporting requirements for pre-
enactment swaps.&#39;&#39; In other words, our regulators have been=20
forced to undertake additional rulemaking in an effort to=20
correct the inconsistencies and errors in the Dodd-Frank Act.=20
And although I am not sure how rules can alter statutory=20
requirements, it is clear that Dodd-Frank has some fundamental=20
flaws and should be revisited.
    Today I look forward to hearing how the regulators plan to=20
improve this broken regulatory process, particularly how they=20
will consider and incorporate comments from the public.
    Make no mistake. The unprecedented scale and scope of=20
agency rulemakings mandated by the Dodd-Frank derivatives title=20
make it impossible for regulators to engage in deliberative and=20
rational rulemaking and still meet the unrealistic deadlines=20
imposed by the act.
    I am also concerned that the regulators are not fully=20
considering the costs and benefits of the rules and the effect=20
that these rules could have on our markets and job creation in=20
the country.
    As the American economy continues to struggle, this may be=20
the most important facet of the current regulatory process. I=20
think it must not be overlooked.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. I would like to welcome and introduce the=20
witnesses on our first panel:
    The Honorable Mary Schapiro is Chairman of the U.S.=20

    STATEMENT OF MARY L. SCHAPIRO, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND=20
                      EXCHANGE COMMISSION

    Ms. Schapiro. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking=20
Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for=20
inviting me to testify today on behalf of the Securities and=20
Exchange Commission regarding the implementation of Title VII=20
and Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding a regulatory=20
framework for derivatives. It is a pleasure to appear with my=20
colleagues Chairman Gensler, Governor Tarullo, and Assistant=20
Secretary Miller.
    As you know, Title VII and VIII are intended to bring=20
greater oversight and transparency to the derivatives markets=20
and to payment, clearing, and settlement systems and activities=20
and, with that, to increase the stability of our financial=20
markets.
    While implementing these provisions is a complex and=20
challenging undertaking, particularly in light of our other=20
regulatory responsibilities, we recognize the importance of=20
this task, and we are very committed to getting it right.
    These rules are intended, among other things, to reduce=20
counterparty risk by bringing transparency and centralized=20
clearing to security-based swaps, reduce systemic risk, protect=20
investors by increasing disclosure, and establish a regulatory=20
framework that allows OTC derivatives markets to continue to=20
develop in a transparent, efficient, accessible, and=20
competitive manner.
    Since passage of the legislation, we have been very engaged=20
in an open and transparent implementation process, seeking=20
input on the various rules from interested parties even before=20
issuing formal rule proposals.
    Our staff has sought meetings with a broad cross-section of=20
interested parties. We joined with the CFTC to hold public=20
roundtables and hearings, and we have been meeting regularly=20
with other financial regulators to ensure consistent and=20
comparable definitions and requirements across the rulemaking=20
landscape.
    To date, the SEC already has proposed a number of security-
based swap-related rules. Among them are rules that would=20
address potential conflicts of interest at security-based swap=20
clearing agencies, security-based swap execution facilities,=20
and exchanges that trade security-based swaps; rules that would=20
specify who must report security-based swap transactions, what=20
information must be reported, and where and when it must be=20
reported; rules that would require security-based swap data=20
repositories to register with the SEC; rules that would define=20
security-based swap execution facilities and establish=20
requirements for their registration and ongoing operations;=20
rules that would specify information that clearing agencies=20
would provide to the SEC in order for us to determine if the=20
swaps must be cleared and specify the steps that end users must=20
follow to rely on the exemption from clearing requirements; and=20
rules that establish standards for the operation and governance=20
of clearing agencies. In addition, with the CFTC, we have=20
proposed rules regarding the definitions of several of the key=20
terms within the Dodd-Frank Act.
    Our staff also is working closely with the Federal Reserve=20
Board and the CFTC to develop a common framework for=20
supervising financial market utilities, such as clearing=20
agencies, which are designated by the Financial Stability=20
Oversight Council as systemically important. In the coming=20
months, we expect to propose rules to establish registration=20
procedures for security-based swap dealers and major security-
based swap participants and rules regarding business conduct,=20
capital, margins, segregation, and record keeping requirements=20
for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap=20
participants. We will also propose joint rules with the CFTC=20
governing the definitions of swap and security-based swap, as=20
well as the regulation of mixed swaps.
    We recognize the magnitude and interconnectedness of the=20
derivatives market, and so we intend to move forward at a=20
deliberate pace, continuing to thoughtfully consider issues=20
before proposing and adopting specific rules and working=20
closely with our domestic counterparts and international=20
regulators.
    The Dodd-Frank Act provides the SEC with important tools to=20
better meet the challenges of today&#39;s financial marketplace and=20
fulfill our mission to protect investors, maintain fair,=20
orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital=20
formation. As we proceed with implementation, we look forward=20
to continuing to work closely with Congress, all the=20
regulators, and members of the financial community, and the=20
investing public.
    Thank you for inviting me to share with you our progress on=20
and plans for implementation, and I look forward to answering=20
your questions.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Schapiro.
    Chairman Gensler, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF GARY GENSLER, CHAIRMAN, COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING=20
                           COMMISSION

    Mr. Gensler. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking=20
Member Shelby, and Members of this Committee. I thank you for=20
inviting me here today. I am pleased to testify on behalf of=20
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and I also thank my=20
fellow Commissioners and all of the staff at the CFTC for their=20
hard work and commitment in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. I=20
am pleased to testify along with my fellow regulators Chairman=20
Schapiro and Governor Tarullo, who I had the honor to be=20
announced with by then President-elect Obama 2\1/2\ years ago,=20
so we get to be together, and Assistant Secretary Mary Miller.=20
We have known each other now for about 15 years, so it is great=20
to be here together.
    The CFTC is working very closely with the SEC, the Federal=20
Reserve, and other regulators in the U.S. and overseas. We are=20
coordinating and consulting with international regulators to=20
harmonize oversight of the swaps market, and we have received=20
thousands of comments today both before we have made proposals=20
and after we have made proposals. At this point in the process,=20
the CFTC has proposed rules in 29 of the 31 areas that the=20
Dodd-Frank Act required us to do so, including proposing rules=20
this morning on margin, which, of course, as well the Federal=20
Reserve and other prudential regulators took up.
    Consistent with what Congress did in exempting nonfinancial=20
end users from clearing, the proposed rule would not require=20
margin to be paid or collected on transactions involving=20
nonfinancial end users hedging or mitigating commercial risk.
    Over the next several weeks, it is our goal to largely=20
complete the mosaic of proposed rules by proposing rules=20
relating to capital as well as the joint product definition=20
rule along with the SEC and segregation for cleared swaps. And=20
it is our goal to try to complete that in the next several=20
weeks.
    One component that we have asked the public about is=20
phasing of implementation. We have not moved to any final rules=20
yet. The whole mosaic will be out there, but implementation is=20
very important. The SEC and the CFTC actually earlier today=20
jointly announced that we would ask the public more on this. We=20
have asked on every one of our rules, but we want to do it in a=20
coordinated way. So early in May we are going to hold 2 days of=20
public roundtables to hear about effective dates and=20
implementation schedules, which compliance should come later,=20
which may be earlier, how it should be phased, whether by asset=20
class, by market participant, or by other characteristics.
    We have also put a dedicated comment file up on our Web=20
site today so that people can comment on this very important=20
issue.
    We will be considering final rules only after staff can=20
analyze, summarize, and consider comments, after the=20
Commissioners themselves can provide feedback, and after we can=20
consult with other regulators not only here but around the=20
globe.
    Before I conclude, I just want to briefly talk about=20
resources. I appreciate any and all that this Committee did now=20
that we are going to move forward and get some breathing room=20
and certainty in 2011 funding. But the CFTC is a good=20
investment, and it has been asked to take on a much more=20
significant role than just overseeing the futures marketplace.=20
The futures marketplace is about $40 trillion in notional size,=20
maybe about $2.50 to $3 in futures for every dollar in the=20
economy. But the swaps marketplace that we have been asked to=20
oversee is $300 trillion in size here in the U.S. Give or take,=20
$20 of swaps for every dollar in the economy. We share that=20
role with the SEC, but clearly it is 7 times the futures=20
marketplace.
    We are a good investment, even with what it just looks like=20
Congress will be recommending this week, $202 million. It is=20
dwarfed by the size of the financial industry itself, which is=20
measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues. So=20
the President has put forward a plan for us at $308 million=20
next year. I look forward to working with this Committee and=20
the appropriators on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses=20
to see how we can assure that we have the resources to fulfill=20
the mission.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Gensler.
    Governor Tarullo, please proceed.

 STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF=20
                   THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

    Mr. Tarullo. Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, and other=20
Members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to=20
provide the Federal Reserve Board&#39;s views on the implementation=20
of Title VII of Dodd-Frank. The Board&#39;s responsibilities fall=20
into three broad areas. The first relates to coordination and=20
consultation with other authorities, both domestic and foreign.
    As to domestic consultation, Dodd-Frank requires that the=20
CFTC and the SEC consult with the Board on rules to implement=20
Title VII. In providing comments to the two market regulators,=20
we have tried to bring to bear our experience from supervising=20
dealers and market infrastructures and our familiarity with=20
markets and data sources.
    There are also very important international coordination=20
activities related to derivatives. Most prominently, the Group=20
of 20, or G-20 leaders, sometime ago established commitments=20
related to reform of the OTC derivatives market that would form=20
a broadly consistent international regulatory approach. In an=20
effort to implement the various portions of that commitment,=20
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems is working with=20
the International Organization of Securities Commissions to=20
update international standards for systemically important=20
clearing systems, including central counterparties that clear=20
derivatives instruments, and trade repositories.
    Even before the G-20 leaders initiative, the Basel=20
Committee on Banking Supervision had established capital=20
standards for derivatives. More recently, the committee has=20
strengthened those standards and has created leverage and=20
liquidity standards which will be applicable to them.
    The goal of all of these efforts should be a level playing=20
field that will promote both financial stability and fair=20
competitive conditions to the fullest extent possible. And I=20
think for all of the agencies represented here today, the=20
pursuit of this end is going to need to remain a priority for=20
some time.
    The second task given to the Federal Reserve under Title=20
VII relates to the strengthening of infrastructure. Central=20
counterparties are given an expanded role in the clearing and=20
settlement of swap and security-based swap transactions. If=20
properly designed, managed, and overseen, central=20
counterparties offer an important tool for managing=20
counterparty credit risk, and thus reducing risk to market=20
participants and to the financial system.
    Title VII of the act complements the role of central=20
clearing by heightening supervisory oversight of systemically=20
important financial market utilities. This heightened oversight=20
is important because financial market utilities such as central=20
counterparties concentrate risk and thus have the potential to=20
transmit shocks throughout the financial markets.
    As part of Title VIII, the Board was given new authority to=20
provide emergency collateralized liquidity in unusual and=20
exigent circumstances to systemically important financial=20
market utilities. We are at present carefully considering how=20
to implement this provision in a manner that protects taxpayers=20
and limits the rise in moral hazard.
    The third task committed to the Board by Dodd-Frank is that=20
of supervision. Capital and margin requirements are central to=20
the prudential regulation of financial institutions active in=20
derivatives markets as well as to the internal risk management=20
processes of those firms. The major rulemaking responsibility=20
of the Board and the other prudential regulators is to adopt=20
capital and margin regulations for the noncleared swaps of=20
banks and other prudentially regulated entities that are swap=20
dealers or major swap participants.
    The Board and the other U.S. banking agencies played an=20
active role in developing the enhanced capital leverage and=20
liquidity regime that I mentioned before. These requirements=20
will strengthen the prudential framework for OTC derivatives by=20
increasing risk-based capital and leverage requirements and=20
requiring banking firms to hold an additional buffer of high-
quality liquid assets to address potential liquidity needs=20
resulting from their derivatives portfolios.
    The statute also requires the prudential regulators to=20
adopt rules imposing initial and variation margins on=20
noncleared swaps to which swap dealers or major swap=20
participants that they supervise are a party.
    The statute directs that these margin requirements be risk-
based. In accordance with the statutory instruction, the Board=20
and other prudential regulators proposed to implement the=20
margin provisions in a way that recognizes the low systemic=20
risk posed by most end users. The proposed rule would not=20
specify a minimum margin requirement. Rather, it would allow a=20
banking organization that is a dealer or major participant to=20
establish a threshold based on a credit exposure limit that is=20
approved and monitored as a part of the normal credit approval=20
process, below which the end user would not have to post=20
margin.
    Finally, I would note that the proposed regulation provides=20
that the margin requirement should be applied only to contracts=20
entered into after the new requirement becomes effective.
    Thank you for your attention.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Governor Tarullo.
    Assistant Secretary Miller, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF MARY J. MILLER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FINANCIAL=20
              MARKETS, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

    Ms. Miller. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and=20
Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify=20
today about Treasury&#39;s role in implementing Dodd-Frank&#39;s=20
derivatives provisions.
    As you know, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into=20
law almost 9 months ago. The act established a framework for=20
the country to build a stronger, safer, and more competitive=20
financial system. It creates safeguards to protect consumers=20
and investors, end taxpayer bailouts, and improve the=20
transparency, efficiency, and liquidity of U.S. markets. The=20
derivatives provisions are a critical part of that framework,=20
and the Administration strongly supports them. Dodd-Frank&#39;s=20
derivatives provisions will shed light on a market that=20
previously operated in the shadows. Central clearing, trade=20
execution, and reporting requirements and business conduct=20
standards will provide substantial benefits. The work that the=20
Administration is undertaking in partnership with our=20
colleagues at the CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve Board is vital=20
in preventing the harmful buildup of risk that contributed so=20
greatly to the financial crisis in 2008.
    As other Treasury officials have previously testified,=20
several broad principles guide our implementation efforts.=20
First, we are moving quickly to meet the statute&#39;s deadlines,=20
but we are also moving carefully to make sure that as we=20
implement the act we get it right.
    Second, we are bringing transparency to the process so that=20
as many stakeholders as possible have a seat at the table, the=20
American people know who is at that table, and anyone who wants=20
to provide input on requests for comment and proposed=20
rulemakings can do so.
    We are creating a more coordinated regulatory process. The=20
Financial Stability Oversight Council is playing a key role by=20
bringing together the financial regulatory agencies to help=20
develop consistent and comparable regulations and supervisory=20
regimes.
    Fourth, we are building a level playing field by setting=20
high standards in the United States and working diligently with=20
our international counterparts to follow our lead.
    Fifth, we are crafting rules of the road that will provide=20
U.S. investors and institutions the conditions they need to=20
invest capital, develop innovative products, and compete=20
globally.
    Finally, we are committed to regularly keeping Congress=20
informed about our progress. The Treasury Secretary has=20
specific statutory responsibilities with respect to derivatives=20
implementation and also has other responsibilities in his=20
capacity as the Chairman of the FSOC.
    Starting with the specific, Congress gave the Secretary the=20
authority to determine whether foreign exchange swaps and=20
forwards should be exempt from the definition of swap in the=20
Commodity Exchange Act. The Secretary must consider the=20
statutory factors set forth by the Dodd-Frank Act, including=20
the impact regulating FX swaps and forwards swaps under the CEA=20
would have on systemic risk and financial stability; the=20
existing regulatory regime and supervision of FX swaps and=20
forward participants; and, finally, whether an exemption could=20
lead to evasion of other regulatory requirements.
    We published a request for comments to solicit public input=20
on a wide range of issues relating to a potential exemption. We=20
received 30 comments in response, and Treasury staff has also=20
conducted an independent analysis, including extensive=20
discussions with a range of interested parties.
    We know that market participants, other stakeholders, and=20
the Committee are closely following this issue. Regardless of=20
the decision the Secretary makes, market participants need to=20
be able to prepare for it. While we intend to move=20
expeditiously, it is also critical that we take enough time to=20
make the right decision for the safety and soundness of the=20
markets.
    The Secretary also has derivatives implementation=20
responsibilities in his capacity as FSOC Chairman. The FSOC=20
recently approved the publication of a Notice of Proposed=20
Rulemaking regarding the designation of systemically important=20
financial market utilities. FMUs support and facilitate the=20
transfer, clearing, and settlement of financial transactions,=20
and they form a critical part of the Nation&#39;s financial=20
infrastructure. The notice was published on March 28th and will=20
be open for comments for 60 days.
    One final area I would like to touch on is the importance=20
of comparable international standards, including derivatives=20
oversight. The United States will set high standards, but=20
today&#39;s financial system is highly interconnected, mobile, and=20
global. We must work not only to protect the competitiveness of=20
U.S. financial markets but also to ensure that the reforms we=20
implement here are not undermined by lax standards elsewhere.
    We will continue to work at home and abroad to build a=20
regulatory framework for derivatives that will help our=20
financial system become safer and sounder and a platform on=20
which we can build strong financial markets that will fuel our=20
economic growth.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Miller. I=20
will start off the questions. Thanks for your testimony.
    I will remind my colleagues that we will keep the record=20
open for statements, questions, and any other material you=20
would like to submit. As we begin questioning the witnesses, I=20
will put 5 minutes on the clock for each Member&#39;s questions.
    Chairman Schapiro and Chairman Gensler, how do you plan to=20
reconcile the different SEC and CFTC proposed rulemakings=20
governing swap execution facilities, real time reporting, block=20
trades, and other infrastructure consistent with Dodd-Frank&#39;s=20
requirement to assure regulatory consistency and comparability=20
and treat functionally or economically similar products or=20
entities in a similar manner?
    Ms. Schapiro. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to start. We=20
are very, very focused, obviously, on the issues surrounding=20
the fact that in a number of areas, and you just articulated=20
several of them, we do have differences in our rule sets=20
between the SEC and the CFTC. Some of those differences may=20
actually be necessitated by the fact that the markets, while=20
they are both derivatives markets, the products may trade=20
differently, have different liquidity characteristics, and for=20
that reason, some differences may actually be appropriate in=20
order to continue to foster the development of these markets.=20
But we have asked for comment on whether our understanding in=20
that regard is correct.
    But I would also say that we are continuing to work=20
extremely closely together through the proposing stage, and now=20
that for a number of rules comment periods have closed, we were=20
able to review the comments that have come in on our proposals=20
as well as those that have come in on the CFTC&#39;s proposals=20
where they have gone in a slightly different direction and we=20
are very committed to continuing to work through those=20
differences, and if they are not grounded in very good market=20
structure reasons because of the nature of the products, trying=20
to get them as consistent as we possibly can.
    Where we have proposed after the CFTC, I would just add, on=20
some rules, we have actually sought explicitly to get comment=20
on their approach to see if that might be a better way to go=20
forward. So in a number of areas where we do have differences,=20
I believe because we are still at the proposing stage and not=20
at the adopting stage, we will be able to work through many of=20
those differences. And then, of course, through implementation,=20
it may be necessary for either or both of us to engage in some=20
interpretation of our rules in order to ease implementation and=20
make them consistent.
    Mr. Gensler. I will keep it brief. I agree with what=20
Chairman Schapiro said. It is a lot of consultation and=20
coordination. It is also in the context of there are some=20
differences between the futures marketplace and the securities=20
marketplace that either have existed in statute or in rules or=20
just in market practice for decades, and so we are trying to be=20
as close as we can between swaps and securities-based swaps=20
while also not creating some regulatory arbitrage and undercut,=20
for instance, in our case, a futures marketplace that has=20
worked with a great deal of transparency and low risk to the=20
American public, and not undercut that marketplace through some=20
differences, as well. And I suspect the same issues on your=20
side.
    Ms. Schapiro. If I could just add, it is critically=20
important to us, as well, that because securities-based swaps=20
can be economic equivalents to equity positions, that we want=20
to make sure that we do not create, while we are trying to be=20
more and more synched up with the swaps markets, between the=20
security-based swaps and swaps markets, that we are not=20
creating great distance between the security-based swap markets=20
and the equity markets, as well.
    Chairman Johnson. Assistant Secretary Miller and Governor=20
Tarullo, how are Treasury and the Fed working to harmonize=20
international derivatives regulations through the G-20 and the=20
Financial Stability Board, especially given the different=20
international time frames for moving ahead on new rules? How=20
are your efforts in this area being coordinated with the CFTC=20
and the SEC to be sure that requirements for capital and other=20
rules are both appropriate and consistent?
    Ms. Miller. Well, we are following this very closely,=20
because as I said, we are very interested in having good=20
harmonization globally on these rules. So in many settings,=20
Treasury staff are engaging with their counterparts in=20
different international groups. There are a number of working=20
groups on derivatives that are occurring through the Financial=20
Stability Board in Europe. We are also interested in things=20
that are going on in Asia. So we are following both the=20
rulemaking process in the U.S. and we are engaging regularly=20
with our counterparts in other countries.
    Mr. Tarullo. Mr. Chairman, let me add a couple of thoughts=20
there. As you can tell from the testimony today, the other=20
rulemakings that the SEC and the CFTC have ongoing, dealing=20
with the international equivalents of Title VII and Title VIII,=20
are going to implicate a number of different regulatory=20
authorities in other jurisdictions.
    So I think what was looked for by the G-20 was a framework=20
of agreement or commitment on a set of goals that would then be=20
pursued in the various appropriate international bodies. What=20
we have got now, I think, is a good bit of very productive work=20
on efforts to get agreement on central counterparties, on=20
electronic trading, on transparency for those counterparties,=20
on risk management standards. That is being done, I think,=20
through a lot of cooperation among agencies, but in particular,=20
the Fed and the SEC, because, in fact, we have got a Reserve=20
Bank President and a Commissioner of the SEC who are chairing=20
the key international committees on this point--President=20
Dudley of the New York Fed and Commissioner Casey of the SEC.
    On capital, as I said in my prepared remarks, the Basel=20
Committee on Banking Supervision has a set of capital=20
requirements for derivatives in a part of its overall=20
internationally recognized capital standards. They have been=20
updated to take account of what was learned during the crisis,=20
but they are already agreed among all the Basel Committee=20
members, which constitutes not just the G-20 but some=20
additional countries beyond the G-20.
    I think the one area where we probably need some more work=20
now is on margins for noncleared derivatives and noncleared=20
swaps. I think the fact that we, the prudential regulators and=20
the market regulators are now moving toward a proposal for the=20
U.S. is going to enable us to have a clear, coherent, and=20
unified position internationally to try to move along some=20
other countries which are actively, or in some cases not so=20
actively, considering putting these requirements in place.
    With respect to coordination, I think it has been very=20
good. As you can tell from just my recitation of the different=20
committees, we need to have everybody involved because there=20
are different expertises here, and from all accounts that I get=20
from our staff and directly from talking to principals at other=20
agencies, I think this is one area where the convergence of=20
views and the cooperation among U.S. agencies has been quite=20
good.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Shelby.
    Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Assistant Secretary Miller, on our second panel today, we=20
will hear from the Treasurer of FMC, a large manufacturing=20
company here in the U.S., who has grave concerns, according to=20
his testimony, about the excessive regulations mandated by=20
Dodd-Frank. His testimony indicates that these regulations will=20
increase operating costs, making it more difficult for his=20
company to both create jobs and to manage risk. Do you believe=20
that FMC Manufacturing Company, the end user, is the type of=20
company that should be regulated under Dodd-Frank, and does=20
Treasury have any concerns about the potential consequences of=20
Dodd-Frank derivatives regulation on job creation? Have you=20
done any work in this area?
    Ms. Miller. OK. Thank you for the question. We have heard a=20
great deal from end users, nonfinancial and financial in the=20
markets, and I think that there is sufficient flexibility in=20
the Dodd-Frank legislation to work with a company like FMC in=20
terms of providing flexibility under derivatives regulation.
    Senator Shelby. In other words, a company that is an end=20
user that is managing risk but not in the pure financial=20
speculation, is that right?
    Ms. Miller. Yes. We have not done any specific work on the=20
economic impact on job creation of this particular title.
    Senator Shelby. Will you do some research, have Treasury do=20
some research into that area?
    Ms. Miller. Well, we have worked----
    Senator Shelby. Because this could have ramifications for=20
creating jobs, could it not, if it is----
    Ms. Miller. There were many studies mandated by Dodd-Frank=20
and we have been diligently delivering the work that has been=20
delivered under the statute. So we have put out quite a bit on=20
the financial market ramifications.
    Senator Shelby. Foreign exchange swaps and another area.=20
Treasury is charged with determining whether foreign exchange=20
swaps and forwards should be subject to extensive Government=20
regulation. In your testimony today, you stated that, quote--I=20
will quote you--``we want to move expeditiously with respect to=20
making the determination that the treatment of foreign=20
exchange--about the treatment of foreign exchange and swaps.&#39;&#39;=20
When will Treasury make its determination, in your judgment?
    Ms. Miller. So I regret that I do not have that decision to=20
give you today for the hearing. I think we are very close. We=20
have been working on that----
    Senator Shelby. Would you furnish that for the record and=20
the other Committee Members when you get it?
    Ms. Miller. We absolutely will, and we would be delighted=20
to come up and brief you on our decision either way.
    Senator Shelby. Are you at Treasury aware of any market=20
failure in the foreign exchange market that would justify=20
further regulation?
    Ms. Miller. There are many parts of the foreign exchange=20
market. The FX swaps and forwards part that you just mentioned=20
is one part of the foreign exchange market----
    Senator Shelby. Are you aware of any failures in that area=20
that would justify further regulation?
    Ms. Miller. I think there are many parts of that market=20
that were under severe stress during the financial crisis and=20
some parts of it will be subject to Dodd-Frank regulation.
    Senator Shelby. To your knowledge, were any of the areas in=20
derivatives where you are managing risk and you are an end user=20
under extreme stress? I do not know of any.
    Ms. Miller. I would be happy to reply to that question with=20
further research if you want specific examples----
    Senator Shelby. Will you do that for the record?
    Ms. Miller. Sure.
    Senator Shelby. OK. Governor Tarullo, central=20
clearinghouses is an area which is very important. Last week,=20
Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve gave a speech about=20
the importance of properly regulating clearinghouses. He noted=20
that one of the reasons that clearinghouses have not had=20
trouble to date is, quote, ``good luck.&#39;&#39; We cannot always=20
count on good luck, as you know. Beyond relying on luck, what=20
steps can we take, or can you take, to ensure that taxpayers=20
are never called upon to bail out clearinghouses because that=20
was a concern of a lot of us when we were debating the Dodd-
Frank legislation, as you will recall.
    Mr. Tarullo. Right. I do recall your questions on that=20
topic, Senator, a year or two ago. So with respect to the=20
central clearing parties that are designated as systemically=20
important, there will be oversight by the appropriate market=20
regulator, but the Federal Reserve has a role to play there as=20
well. We have a consultative role. We hope to be involved in=20
the exams, bringing to bear, if I can put it this way, a=20
supervisory or prudential supervisory perspective on these=20
institutions. So we would hope that they will all be subject to=20
strong prudential requirements for credit risk, strong=20
liquidity buffers----
    Senator Shelby. What does ``hope&#39;&#39; mean? Now, you said you=20
would hope----
    Mr. Tarullo. The mechanism here is one--the primary=20
regulators are the market regulators.
    Senator Shelby. I know. We know.
    Mr. Tarullo. We have a consultative role----
    Senator Shelby. Oversight role.
    Mr. Tarullo. We have an oversight role, that is correct,=20
and in that capacity, I think we will hope to contribute to the=20
perspective on the supervision of these organizations. I=20
suspect that there will be convergence among the agencies on=20
the kind of standards that are important, and, as I said, I=20
think we are going to draw on our experience not just with=20
market entities, which we do have, but also supervising from a=20
prudential point of view, looking to safety and soundness and=20
not simply market operations.
    Senator Shelby. In the same type area, the United Kingdom&#39;s=20
Financial Services Authority wrote a comment letter in response=20
to a rule proposed by the CFTC on risk management requirements=20
for clearinghouses. The FSA, the United Kingdom&#39;s Financial=20
Services Authority, warned the CFTC that lax eligibility=20
requirements for firms to be members of clearinghouses could=20
create new risk to the financial system. Do you agree with=20
FSA&#39;s comments, or are you concerned about that, too?
    Mr. Tarullo. Senator, I have not seen the FSA comment on=20
the proposed CFTC rule. I would say that an effective member=20
qualification and default set of standards is very important to=20
the integrity of any central clearing party.
    Senator Shelby. Should not you or we, we altogether, should=20
not we do everything we possibly can do to ensure that there is=20
no bailout of a clearinghouse?
    Mr. Tarullo. Absolutely, Senator. I think that is why we=20
all, everybody up there, everybody at the table here, share an=20
interest in having rigorous and effectively enforced standards=20
for the central clearing parties.
    Senator Shelby. Can I get Chairman Gensler&#39;s comments on=20
that, because that is in his area.
    Mr. Gensler. It is a big yes. I think that central=20
clearinghouses need robust oversight. I view it as a=20
partnership with the Federal Reserve, even we might be the=20
front line and, of course, the SEC has their clearinghouses, as=20
well. I think they should not have central bank liquidity,=20
though Dodd-Frank did allow for it in emergency exigent=20
circumstances when the Secretary and the Board of Governors=20
decide that. But I think that should be an absolute rare=20
occurrence. It should not happen.
    Clearinghouses have not failed in this country. We have=20
survived two World Wars and we have survived great crises. I=20
think the clearinghouses have to have collection of margin.=20
They have to have it on a daily basis. They have to be able to=20
have proper default management and so forth----
    Senator Shelby. They have to make sure everything clears,=20
do they not?
    Mr. Gensler. They absolutely have to make sure everything=20
clears, and that which clears has available pricing, available=20
liquidity. And I think also with regard to the comment letter=20
that you referred from the----
    Senator Shelby. From the U.K.----
    Mr. Gensler. ----from the U.K., it is very important that=20
these clearinghouses have open membership, that the access to=20
the clearinghouse is not just so narrow--clearinghouses have=20
greater risk if it is only narrow membership. But if it is=20
broadened out, markets work best when they are open and=20
competitive.
    Senator Shelby. Since there are international implications=20
to derivatives and derivatives trading and everything, should=20
we not listen to our counterparts in Europe, like the United=20
Kingdom and FSA and others who have similar concerns that we=20
should have?
    Mr. Gensler. Absolutely, and we are listening. We are=20
consulting with sharing all our drafts, our term sheets, our=20
memos with not just the FSA, but ESMA and the European=20
Commission and the like. So their comment is very helpful, but=20
we also believe that membership should be opened up, but the=20
smaller members can only scale into that membership and not be=20
like the large members. Right now, the clearinghouse they are=20
thinking about has sort of an exclusive club deal and I think=20
Congress spoke to that in the statute, saying there is supposed=20
to be open access.
    Senator Shelby. Yes. Exclusive clubs are dangerous things=20
sometimes.
    Mr. Gensler. Yes, and that is what occurs in swaps clearing=20
today, not in futures clearing. Futures clearing is much more=20
open. Securities clearing is much more open. Swaps clearing=20
today has been more exclusive, but Dodd-Frank actually said it=20
had to be more open and competitive.
    Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Reed.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Let me begin by associating myself with the comments=20
Senator Shelby made about the utility of clearing platforms to=20
dissipate the risk vis-a-vis bilateral transaction, but the=20
inherent danger of not-well-regulated trades create, and I know=20
everyone at this table is acutely focused on that and I urge=20
you, as Senator Shelby did, to keep your focus on that issue.
    But Secretary Miller, following up on another line of=20
questioning of Senator Shelby about forex contracts, were these=20
contracts part of the Lehman bankruptcy, i.e., were there=20
losses incurred when Lehman failed because they could not=20
fulfill forex contracts, and would those losses have been=20
avoided if the contracts were traded or cleared?
    Ms. Miller. There were open contracts with Lehman Brothers=20
when they failed. Those contracts were settled, so they were=20
able to be settled.
    Senator Reed. And they were settled how?
    Ms. Miller. A large number of them moved through a payment=20
versus payment settlement system. I cannot give you the precise=20
percentage that were settled that way, but it is my=20
understanding that all of the open contracts through Lehman=20
Brothers were settled.
    Senator Reed. Governor Tarullo, did the Federal Reserve in=20
any way support the forex market during the months, the late=20
months of 2008?
    Mr. Tarullo. Well, it was not support for the foreign=20
exchange market as such, Senator. There was liquidity provided=20
in the form of dollar liquidity, both through the discount=20
window directly to institutions operating in the United States=20
and to central banks of some other countries. But this was not=20
in pursuit of settling foreign exchange swaps. This was as a=20
byproduct of the general liquidity squeeze that----
    Senator Reed. But part of their exposure was the foreign=20
exchange contracts?
    Mr. Tarullo. I do not think it was--I think it was much=20
more a funding problem, a dollar funding problem. It was not a=20
matter of failing on a contract but not having access to=20
wholesale funding in dollars when you had obligations in=20
dollars.
    Senator Reed. But there is a possibility, if these=20
contracts are exempt, that there could be another situation=20
where--a liquidity freeze where it is not a question of=20
settlement, they just cannot get the money to settle, and the=20
Fed is prepared or will enter into supporting this sector?
    Mr. Tarullo. Well, Senator, under Dodd-Frank, we are not=20
permitted to offer institutions specific assistance except=20
obviously for the discount window or through the FMU provisions=20
here. I think--and Secretary Miller alluded to this--I think=20
most people who have studied this issue think that the problems=20
in the foreign exchange market have largely concentrated on=20
settlement. There is a quite short duration of most forex=20
forwards. As you may know, all the international work on=20
foreign exchange transactions began after the 1974 failure of=20
Herstatt Bank, which produced these kinds of settlement=20
problems.
    So I think that is where most of the attention has been=20
focused, and today, there are, I would not say perfect or all=20
comprehensive mechanisms for making sure that foreign exchange=20
transactions settle, but there has been a substantial amount of=20
improvement over the last 36 years.
    Senator Reed. I have approximately a minute and a half, so=20
Governor Tarullo, you can explain to me the interaction between=20
the capital requirements of the Volcker Rule for companies that=20
have derivative activities and Basel III and the general=20
prudential guidelines for capital that you are developing for=20
financial security, and the clock is ticking.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Tarullo. So, I am sorry, what are the three areas=20
again?
    Senator Reed. Under Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule has some=20
specialized language with respect to companies, financial=20
companies trading derivatives. There is also the Basel III=20
requirements that talk about derivatives. And then there is=20
just the general prudential safeguards for capital that the Fed=20
can insist on a case-by-case basis----
    Mr. Tarullo. Oh, sure.
    Senator Reed. ----a general basis. So in your mind, are=20
these separate categories, or does this blend into one sort of=20
gut feeling about how much capital a company should have?
    Mr. Tarullo. Well, now it is not going to be a gut feeling.=20
There will be an analytic backdrop for it, and I think there=20
already is. We devoted a lot of attention even before the Basel=20
III process to improving the market risk part of the general=20
capital standards and derivatives were one of the focuses for=20
attention, including important upgrades to counterparty risk,=20
evaluation and capital set-asides, and also to making sure that=20
you stressed the potential exposures as opposed to just a=20
random test through a normal market environment.
    I think with respect to any capital authority that we have,=20
our aim will be to have a set of rules, backstopped by specific=20
supervisory oversight, which ensure that those activities are=20
not creating risk to the institution that does not have an=20
adequate set-aside. That is what existed in the precrisis=20
period. There were opportunities for arbitrage that were=20
readily taken by firms. I think there was inattention to=20
counterparty risk, both at the firm level and among regulators.=20
Those are the kind of changes that need to be put in place, and=20
those are the kind of changes that are in the rules that we are=20
promulgating under Basel III but with an eye to the specifics=20
of a firm, not just to sort of a gut feeling about that firm.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Governor.=20
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Corker.
    Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank all of=20
you for being here, as usual.
    I think the notion of a clearinghouse was something that--
or focusing on clearing trades was something that was very=20
bipartisan in nature. Obviously, you move into details and=20
there ends up being some differences, especially on the end=20
user piece. But for what it is worth, among market=20
participants, and we, obviously, like you, are talking to many=20
among those on the buy side and the sell side, and those who=20
strongly supported Dodd-Frank and those who obviously oppose=20
it, I think there is a concern about the rapidity that these=20
rules are being put in place and even more so on their=20
prescriptive nature, OK, and just being overly prescriptive.
    So with that, Mr. Gensler, I am going to focus on a few=20
things with you. I noticed that people have to have five quotes=20
now, for instance. Even a large institutional trader that might=20
have a relationship with one institution has to have five=20
quotes, and I am wondering, who is it you are trying to help or=20
save, or what is the point behind that?
    Mr. Gensler. Senator, I think you are referring to the swap=20
execution facility----
    Senator Corker. That is right. That is right.
    Mr. Gensler. ----in the proposed rule, and in that regard,=20
Congress said that those transactions that are cleared and made=20
available for trading would be brought to swap execution=20
facilities. That is a mandate and it is transparency. Congress=20
in the statute said that it would be to promote pretrade=20
transparency.
    These are trades that are not large blocks. The blocks are=20
excepted. So it might be a $5 or $10 million trade, not a $500=20
million trade, and it is one that is cleared so it is=20
anonymous. There is no credit risk.
    On those trades, what Congress suggested we do and what we=20
think we are doing in the rule is promoting transparency where=20
multiple participants have an ability to execute against other=20
multiple participants. In the futures marketplace, when a=20
request for quote goes out, it goes out to the whole=20
marketplace. It does not even go just to five. It goes out to a=20
broader group in the marketplace, and the quotes that come back=20
in are seen by the marketplace. So there is far more liquidity.=20
What we are proposing is actually less transparency than the=20
futures marketplace.
    Senator Corker. So on the large block trades, they are=20
excluded----
    Mr. Gensler. They are excluded.
    Senator Corker. ----and do you think this was something=20
wise that we asked you to do, just briefly, yes or no?
    Mr. Gensler. Yes.
    Senator Corker. OK.
    Mr. Gensler. Yes.
    Senator Corker. The real-time reporting, I noticed you have=20
come up with a 15-minute time frame. I am just curious about=20
what was magic about that. I know numbers of people think that=20
is not long enough, especially in larger transactions.
    Mr. Gensler. Well, I am glad you asked. Congress said that=20
real-time reporting after the trade should be as soon as=20
technologically practicable on the smaller trades, and then on=20
the blocks, we could have a delay. So we looked at what delay=20
do we have in the futures marketplace. It is about 5 minutes=20
now. We proposed 15 minutes if it is on a swap execution=20
facility. If it is bilateral, we asked a lot of questions and=20
sought comment. In the securities world, Chairman Schapiro=20
could speak better, but I think their delay is 90 seconds now.=20
So we looked at this and said it is three times the futures=20
world, about ten times the securities world. We are going to=20
get comments. The proposal will change once we get to a final=20
rule, but that was the thinking.
    Senator Corker. So on the larger trades, it may be much=20
longer. It may be end of day. It may be something----
    Mr. Gensler. Well, I----
    Senator Corker. ----the block----
    Mr. Gensler. The larger trades that are on a swap execution=20
facility, we proposed 15 minutes.
    Senator Corker. Right.
    Mr. Gensler. If it is a bilateral, we did not propose a=20
specific time. We just asked a lot of questions.
    Senator Corker. And is it your vision--a lot of people=20
think that it is, so I will give you that editorial comment,=20
but do you think the derivatives market and equity markets=20
should be very similar when you finish all of these activities?
    Mr. Gensler. I think that markets work best when they are=20
transparent, open, and competitive, and those three core=20
factors, whether it be futures or securities, or derivatives,=20
ultimately help end users, investors, and I think it helps the=20
economy grow. It does shift some of the information advantage=20
to the tens of thousands of users away from the most=20
sophisticated----
    Senator Corker. So that is a yes?
    Mr. Gensler. I think it is a yes----
    Senator Corker. I think there are a lot of concerns because=20
people view the two instruments as being very different and I=20
think there is some concern out there that that is your vision=20
and it is not taking into account the differences between the=20
instruments.
    Mr. Gensler. Senator, I think you asked about equities and=20
derivatives and we regulate futures. I think markets work best,=20
whether they are futures, equities, or swaps, when they are=20
transparent. When they are competitive, people get the benefit=20
of that competition in contrast to a closed or dark market.
    Senator Corker. If derivatives are moving out to electronic=20
platforms, is there any concern about a growth of high-
frequency trading taking place in that area?
    Mr. Gensler. It is something that captivates our commission=20
every day in the futures marketplace, when 85 to 90 percent of=20
the marketplace is now electronic. It is something that we=20
think is very much on our mind as we think about regulation in=20
the swaps marketplace.
    Senator Corker. And we look forward to having you in our=20
office, and I am sorry we have not.
    If I could ask one more question to Mr. Tarullo or Ms.=20
Miller, either one, you know, we had a lot of discussions, I=20
remember, in the hearing room when Mr. Volcker came in and=20
started talking about the Volcker Rule, sort of a flower in the=20
middle of regulation. It ended up being a part of Dodd-Frank.=20
And I am out, as I know all of you are, and certainly my=20
colleagues. We talk with banks throughout our country, small=20
community banks and others, about the Examiner in Charge, and=20
the Examiner in Charge that comes into their institution,=20
basically, their attitude, their understanding of whatever=20
regulator it is they are working with changes pretty=20
dramatically how their bank&#39;s status is interpreted, OK. The=20
Examiner in Charge is basically king.
    As you look at the Volcker Rule, again, Mr. Volcker, who I=20
respect greatly and I think everybody up here does, could not=20
really describe to us what propped trading was. You just know=20
it when you see it. How are you all going to sort of=20
institutionalize the whole Volcker issue when, again, you have=20
these examiners, EICs, that are out amongst these various=20
institutions that have judgment? I do not see how you do that=20
properly and I would love to have any help with understanding=20
that.
    Mr. Tarullo. Senator, I think there are a couple of things.=20
First, when you are talking about 7,000 financial institutions=20
as you are with some of the very basic prudential standards,=20
the balance is always as between allowing for the local=20
knowledge of the examiner-in-charge, because he or she is going=20
to understand the institution they are in better than anybody,=20
on the one hand, and on the other hand, assuring a consistency=20
in treatment across everybody in the United States because=20
people deserve that.
    When it comes to something like the Volcker Rule or a=20
number of the other provisions that we are talking about, you=20
are almost surely dealing with a much smaller subset of=20
institutions, and I think there, the kind of horizontal=20
approach to regulation and supervision that we have been taking=20
with respect to larger institutions is going to be particularly=20
important.
    So once we, the prudential regulators, come up with the=20
regulations to implement the Volcker Rule, we are going to have=20
to have a coordinated and coherent and unified approach to=20
implementing and overseeing the implementation of that rule,=20
and I would expect that as we have already done with some of=20
our activities over the last couple of years, beginning with=20
the stress tests in early 2009, we will have a process=20
internally to make sure that these things are being implemented=20
consistently, that the CPC teams, the leads of the teams that=20
are in place in the large institutions, have a common framework=20
of knowledge and training, and that we are making sure that the=20
regulatees have an opportunity to come to us, that is to the=20
Board, and to say, we are uncertain about what is going on here=20
or we are not sure we are being treated the same way.
    So I think will it be a task? Yes. Will it be more=20
difficult, I think, than a lot of the other supervisory tasks=20
that we have now? I do not think so. That is not to understate=20
the attention it is going to require. But once we get those=20
rules in place, I think we do have a mechanism for making sure=20
they are applied in a consistent fashion--that people have=20
recourse to come to the Board to ask about the interpretation=20
of a rule.
    Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Brown.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, all=20
four of you, for your work on Dodd-Frank and getting the=20
legislation passed. Passing this bill last July in so many ways=20
was only the beginning of the effort to impose transparency and=20
accountability and unregulated in the opaque and unregulated=20
derivatives markets. It is pretty clear in newspaper reports=20
that the opponents of transparency and the opponents of=20
oversight lost the first fight, but they are working on budget=20
issues to try to restrict a lot of the things that you are=20
trying to do and trying to handcuff your efforts.
    Just listening to your testimony today and looking at the=20
magnitude of the regulatory effort that you are undertaking I=20
think really illustrates the importance of that, so thank you.
    Chairman Gensler, my questions are directed at you. I sent=20
a letter to you back in January about gas price speculation and=20
the importance of the CFTC&#39;s position limits rules in curbing=20
excessive speculation. I am concerned that excessive=20
speculation can once again perhaps seriously hurt our economy.=20
Every time there is a pipeline outage or a refinery fire or=20
trouble in the Middle East, it seems that one reaction of that=20
is speculators and oil companies move in to spike prices up,=20
using that as a typical excuse for that happening.
    The Commodity Markets Oversight Coalition, a group of=20
commercial end users, pointed to 57 studies conducted in the=20
last 5 years showing the role of speculation in driving up=20
asset and commodity prices. In the 1990s, speculative interest=20
in commodities was about 15 to 30 percent typically. Today it=20
is closer to one-half to two-thirds of the market. Financial=20
companies account for over 51 percent of crude oil futures, an=20
increase of 5 percent just in the last month.
    We know what this means to our economy potentially. We know=20
what it means to individual motorists, to small businesses=20
operating on small margins to truckers, to so many others. And=20
we have seen what speculation can do, similar price increases=20
in other commodity markets.
    Last week, the CEO of Starbucks said financial speculators=20
have come into the commodity markets and drove those prices up=20
to historic levels, and as a result of that, the consumer is=20
suffering.
    Chairman Gensler, talk to us about financial speculation,=20
its effect on prices, and then answer this question, if you=20
would. What authority under Dodd-Frank do you have now to=20
combat speculation? What do you need from us in terms of=20
additional tools to carry that out?
    Mr. Gensler. Hedgers meet speculators in marketplaces. From=20
the earliest days in the derivatives marketplace, a farmer=20
planting corn or wheat or soy wanted to hedge a price and lock=20
in that price at harvest time, and it was generally a=20
speculator who was on the other side to assure that price.
    When our agency&#39;s predecessors were formed, it was to make=20
sure that markets were transparent; a hundred percent of the=20
market had to come to a marketplace. Transparency is so=20
important, and it is important that we have the tools, legal=20
and other tools, to combat fraud and manipulation. Position=20
limits were part of that toolkit that we were given in the=20
1930s.
    In Dodd-Frank, that was expanded. It was expanded not just=20
to be futures but also for economically equivalent swaps.
    We are not a price-setting agency, but our agency is to=20
ensure that markets have a certain basic integrity, you can=20
have confidence in them, and they are not so concentrated. You=20
are accurate that speculators, if you might say, somebody who=20
is not in the physical marketing channel, somebody who is not=20
producing or using the oil or natural gas or the corn or wheat,=20
are a large part of the marketplace. They are well over half of=20
the marketplace usually in different parts of the market=20
statistics will show. We put these statistics out every Friday.=20
They are public.
    So what we need to do, I believe, is complete a rule on=20
position limits. Position limits have been in place in the=20
agricultural products for decades and were in the energy=20
products in the 1980s and 1990s. We have a rule out and that=20
the comment period just closed. We actually got--and I=20
misstated it in my written testimony. We got 11,000 comments on=20
this position limit rule, on the energy and agricultural=20
limits. So we are going to need to sort through that. We are=20
going to take a number of months. That is a lot of comments to=20
sort through. Many of them are repetitive.
    To your question, we also need to promote transparency in=20
this marketplace. I think the more transparent, the more market=20
participants can see the aggregates as well as the pricing,=20
that is a very important thing. And I think we need resources,=20
if I might say. This small agency I think is a good investment=20
to ensure the integrity of these markets.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Toomey.
    Senator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very=20
much to all of you for testifying.
    I just cannot help but make one brief observation, which=20
is--gosh, it is just amazing to me. I have here in my hand the=20
CFTC rule on position limits for derivatives. It looks like it=20
is about a 4-point font. It is 25 pages long. And according to=20
CRS, Dodd-Frank calls for 330 rules.
    It is not a criticism of this particular rule, but it=20
strikes me as an incredible cost to the financial institutions=20
that have to understand these, digest these, hire the manpower=20
to then comply with these. And it strikes me as something that=20
could approach a miracle if they are all perfectly consistent=20
and compatible and operate exactly as intended with no=20
unintended consequences. This is really a very, very difficult=20
undertaking, it seems to me, an enormous cost to the financial=20
institutions to comply with. I suppose the very large ones will=20
be able to afford it. Smaller ones, I am not so sure.
    I would like to follow up with a question on the position=20
limits, Mr. Chairman, if I could.
    One is my understanding of Dodd-Frank, which passed before=20
I got here, but my understanding is that the bill does provide=20
some flexibility in terms of how you go about imposing position=20
limits. And my further understanding is that thus far the=20
European regulators have not promulgated any rules whatsoever=20
regarding position limits.
    Is there a danger that if we go ahead and impose position=20
limits and they do not, we simply have a migration of business=20
to other venues? Are you concerned about that at all?
    Mr. Gensler. We are working closely with the European and=20
Asian regulators. I think capital and risk do not know any=20
geographic boundary, so whether it be position limits or other=20
rules, Senator, that is something that we are very conscious=20
of.
    On position limits, I think after numerous hearings,=20
starting probably in 2007 and 2008 in the House and the Senate,=20
our authorities were not only broadened to include economically=20
equivalent swaps, but also something very important, the=20
exclusion from those position limits, called bona fide hedging,=20
was narrowed a bit. So we take congressional direction on this=20
as well.
    Senator Toomey. I understand that, but are you concerned=20
that in the absence of comparable European regulation that we=20
have the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage across borders?
    Mr. Gensler. I would have to say yes, but not just with=20
regard to position limits. That is why we have been so active=20
in Europe and elsewhere to try to harmonize where we can. But=20
in terms of position limits, what we are looking at in the=20
proposal is about futures and options on futures, where we have=20
set them for decades in agriculture. We did in energy in the=20
1980s and 1990s along with the exchanges, and the exchanges=20
took the lead. And it is looking to reimpose those, and we are=20
benefited because, as I said, we have 11,000 public comments in=20
the file right now. So this is one that the public is very=20
engaged in.
    Senator Toomey. Well, I am concerned about this apparent=20
developing disparity between the regulatory regimes.
    Another quickly question, if I could, on the real-time=20
reporting. We had a little discussion earlier about speculators=20
and the fact that speculators--and I completely agree with your=20
observation. Speculators provide a great deal of liquidity. It=20
is often the case that speculators also need to have a certain=20
amount of anonymity, and while transparency has many virtues=20
and can be very important, sometimes anonymity is important,=20
too.
    My understanding is--and maybe you could correct me if I am=20
mistaken--that the CFTC&#39;s 15-minute disclosure requirement is=20
different than the SEC, which has a longer period of time=20
before a comparable transaction has to be disclosed. So is=20
there a difference between the two?
    Ms. Schapiro. There is, Senator, a difference with respect=20
to block transactions, the larger transactions, which are the=20
ones that would give rise to the concern about whether too much=20
information was being revealed that might allow somebody to run=20
ahead of the hedge, for example, on the block.
    Senator Toomey. Right.
    Ms. Schapiro. We have not actually proposed yet standards=20
for how we will define a block transaction. We have asked for=20
comment on that, and then we will propose some specific=20
standards. But we have said that while we would recommend=20
disseminating the price of the transaction in real time, the=20
size of the transaction would not be disseminated for as long=20
as 8 to 26 hours after the transaction.
    Senator Toomey. OK. And, Mr. Gensler, would your goal be to=20
have a harmonization with respect to the SEC&#39;s approach?
    Mr. Gensler. We are working very closely together, not just=20
on real-time reporting, but to try to bring them together as=20
much as we can. Of course, there are differences in the=20
underlying markets. There are differences between futures and=20
securities, and the interest rate market, which is a vast and=20
large market, is different than the credit default swap market,=20
which is largely over at the SEC. So there will still be some=20
differences, but whether it be on the block role, the real-time=20
reporting role, the swap execution role, we are looking to try=20
to get as close as we can, but also respect that there are some=20
gaps between the underlying futures and securities markets.
    Senator Toomey. Well, thank you very much. I see my time=20
has expired.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
    Chairman Gensler, I would like to discuss the core=20
principles issue with you. First of all, I would say just=20
generally the complaint I get from the futures industry is that=20
the CFTC is working at such a furious pace. Difficult to keep=20
up with your rulemaking. I think there are 60 rulemaking=20
procedures ongoing. Difficult to conduct business and continue=20
to comment on the things that are happening at the CFTC. But=20
more troublesome to me is the implementation of a provision in=20
Dodd-Frank that seems unnecessary to me, and that is that the=20
CFTC has operated under a core principles regime, and I think=20
most observers would say survived the disaster of several years=20
ago in a very solid way, in a sound way. And yet as I recall,=20
you asked the House Agriculture Committee in my days there that=20
you have the authority to abandon the core principles and move=20
to a more SEC-type regulatory environment for the futures=20
industry. And I would just question you as to why you believe=20
that the core principles method of regulating the futures=20
industry, which at least in my view or the view of observers=20
that I read and hear, worked well and were moving in an=20
entirely different direction. And I recall this conversation in=20
the House Agriculture Committee with Chairman Peterson in which=20
we were assured that this is a backstop, if it becomes=20
necessary, the CFTC does not intend to go down this path of=20
changing the nature of its regulatory environment in the=20
futures industry. But that is certainly not the way it has=20
turned out to be.
    Where would you characterize my understanding as wrong?
    Mr. Gensler. I would never like to do that with a Senator,=20
but----
    Senator Moran. I appreciate that attitude, but I know you=20
would be thinking it if you did not say it.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Gensler. No, I just want to give a little=20
clarification. The CFTC, as part of the Commodity Futures=20
Modernization Act, got core principles for two areas, but it=20
was not in all the areas. It was for clearing and for trading=20
platforms. We do not have today nor have we had it on oversight=20
of what is called intermediaries, the futures commission=20
merchants and the like. There are many rules there.
    You are absolutely correct, Dodd-Frank gave us a little bit=20
greater ability on the clearing and the trading, and=20
particularly on clearing because now there is a mandate to move=20
what may be $200 to $300 trillion of derivatives into the=20
clearinghouses, that it was thought and I still believe it is=20
thought that this is a place that needs robust risk management,=20
and that we cannot as Americans just rely solely on the good=20
risk management standards of the clearinghouses themselves, but=20
that regulators and the whole Financial Stability Oversight=20
Council have a role and the Federal Reserve has an important=20
role to play advising us and joining in those examinations. So=20
I think in clearing very much so.
    I could say, Senator, though Congress also set a 1-year=20
time limit to put out the rules, we have proposed rules--it is=20
actually 47 as of this morning. We have proposed rules, but we=20
have not finalized any. We are going to get the rest of the=20
proposals out hopefully in the next handful of weeks. The whole=20
mosaic will be out there. Though some comment files have=20
closed, we have discretion to continue to take comments, and=20
using that discretion we do continue to take comments. And we=20
are only going to move forward on final rules when we can=20
sufficiently summarize comments, get Commissioner feedback, get=20
regulatory feedback. We are not going to make the July=20
deadline. I know many people in the markets are probably=20
pleased to hear that. We are only going to do this according to=20
when we are ready to move over the spring, summer, and well=20
into the fall on the timing issue.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, I have two responses to your=20
comments. One, do you have examples of where the regulatory=20
environment that the CFTC operated failed in regard to the=20
circumstances that we found our economy in that cause you to=20
have that sense. And then, second, just generally, your comment=20
about the mosaic, would it be your plan for the industry and=20
for Congress to be able to see the whole mosaic before any of=20
the rules are individually approved and implemented?
    Mr. Gensler. I think to your second question, yes. As the=20
mosaic, we are hopeful to complete, as I said, in the next 3 to=20
5 weeks working with the SEC on one very important joint rule=20
and the capital rules and so forth.
    Senator Moran. So we can see the big picture before we get=20
any ruling taking----
    Mr. Gensler. That is right, and we are also doing some=20
joint meetings that we announced today with the SEC on=20
implementation phasing that we are going to be doing in early=20
May. We have an open comment file that we have put up on that=20
phasing as well.
    I think in terms of your other question, I think that we=20
did not regulate--as a Nation, we did not regulate the swaps=20
marketplace, and it contributed to the crisis that we had in=20
2008. It was not the only reason, but all we need to do is=20
think about credit default swaps and AIG and the=20
interconnectedness of the financial system. So part of the=20
cost--and Senator Toomey referred to the cost the financial=20
industry is taking on, part of that cost is so that the=20
taxpayers do not have to bear as great a risk to bail out=20
financial institutions in the future.
    Senator Moran. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you all of our witnesses on our=20
first panel.
    I would ask those on our second panel to take your place at=20
the witness table. While you get seated, I would like to=20
welcome and introduce the witnesses on our second panel.
    Thomas Deas is vice president and treasurer of the FMC=20

giving me the opportunity in particular to welcome Mr. Thomas=20

STATEMENT OF THOMAS C. DEAS, JR., VICE PRESIDENT AND TREASURER,=20
                        FMC CORPORATION

    Mr. Deas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to you=20
and to Ranking Member Shelby and the Members of the Committee.
    In addition to my role in FMC Corporation, I am also=20
president of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers.=20
FMC and NACT are together members of the Coalition for=20
Derivatives End Users, representing thousands of companies=20
across the country that employ derivatives to manage day-to-day=20
business risk. I would like to express my gratitude to you, Mr.=20
Chairman, and to Ranking Member Shelby, for your bipartisan=20
efforts on behalf of derivative end users, and particularly to=20
Chairman Johnson for your work last week with the other=20
Committee Chairmen in support of end user margin exemption. We=20
also appreciate Senator Johanns&#39; effort to extend the statutory=20
effective date for the proposed regulations, and I thank you,=20
Senator Toomey, and Ranking Member Shelby for your kind words=20
about FMC Corporation and your care and interest for=20
manufacturing companies of which we are a proud one.
    In fact, FMC Corporation was founded almost 130 years ago=20
to provide spray equipment to farmers. Today, in addition=20
making agricultural chemicals that farmers apply to protect=20
their crops, our 5,000 employees have worked hard to make FMC a=20
leading manufacturer and marketer of a whole range of=20
agricultural, specialty, and industrial chemicals. We have=20
achieved this longevity by continually responding to our=20
customers&#39; needs with the right chemistry delivered at the=20
right price. This year marks our 80th anniversary of listing on=20
the New York Stock Exchange. I had the valuable experience on a=20
newer financial market, one that we have been discussing today.=20
I had the opportunity to negotiate and execute some of the very=20
first derivatives--currency swaps--going back to 1984. I have=20
seen the derivatives market grow from its inception in the mid-
1980s to its current size by adapting and responding to market=20
participants&#39; needs.
    We support this Committee&#39;s efforts to redress the problems=20
with derivatives experienced during the financial crisis in=20
2008, but I want to assure you that FMC and other end users=20
were not and are not engaging in risky speculative derivatives=20
transactions. We use over-the-counter derivatives to hedge=20
risks in our business activity. We are offsetting risks, not=20
creating new ones.
    FMC is the world&#39;s largest producer of natural soda ash,=20
the principal input in glass manufacturing, and we are one of=20
the largest employers in the State of Wyoming. We can mine and=20
refine soda ash products in southwestern Wyoming, ship them to=20
South Asia, and deliver them at a lower cost and with higher=20
quality than competing Chinese producers. We have achieved this=20
export success in part because of the derivatives we enter into=20
to hedge natural gas prices. These derivatives are done with=20
several banks, all of which are also supporting FMC through=20
their provision of almost $1 billion of committed credit. Our=20
banks do not require FMC to post cash margin, but they take=20
this risk into account as they price the transaction with us.=20
This structure gives us certainty so that we never have to post=20
cash margin while the derivative is outstanding.
    But the current system, where end users and their=20
counterparties decide collaboratively whether and how margins=20
should apply is changing. Today the FDIC proposed a rule that=20
could in the future subject end users to margin requirements.=20
While we are still reviewing the details, it appears=20
regulators, not market participants, will now determine how=20
margin will be set. Regulators will have the final say over how=20
much cash an end user will have to divert to a margin account=20
where it will sit unavailable for productive uses.
    In our world of finite limits and financial constraints,=20
posting cash margin would be a direct dollar-for-dollar=20
subtraction from funds that we would otherwise use to expand=20
our plants, build inventory to support higher sales, conduct=20
research and development activities, and ultimately sustain and=20
grow jobs.
    In fact, a coalition survey of derivative end users=20
extrapolated the effects of margin requirements across the S&amp;P=20
500, of which FMC is also a member, to predict the consequent=20
loss of 100,000 to 120,000 jobs, depending on these proposed=20
thresholds. The effect on the many thousands of end users=20
beyond the S&amp;P 500 would be proportionately greater.
    Although I have focused here on margin, end users are also=20
concerned about the more than 100 new rules that will determine=20
whether we can continue to manage business risk through=20
derivatives. We have heard also about capital requirements that=20
our counterparties would be required to hold, and we have heard=20
through the publication of rules today that uncleared over-the-
counter derivatives, the kind that we employ to hedge our=20
business risk, are singled out as high-risk transactions, which=20
will attract additional capital we are concerned could be=20
almost punitive and could end that ability of end users like=20
FMC to hedge their business risk with them.
    Thank you very much for your attention. I would be happy to=20
answer your questions.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Deas.
    Mr. Olesky, please proceed.

  STATEMENT OF LEE OLESKY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TRADEWEB=20
                          MARKETS LLC

    Mr. Olesky. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Shelby and=20
Members of the Committee, good afternoon and thank you very=20
much for inviting me to participate in this hearing.
    My name is Lee Olesky. I am the chief executive officer and=20
a founder of Tradeweb, and I appreciate the opportunity to=20
testify today about the regulatory framework for implementation=20
of Title VII of Dodd-Frank.
    For the last 15 years, Tradeweb has been at the forefront=20
of building regulated electronic markets for the trading of OTC=20
fixed income securities and derivatives. Tradeweb&#39;s core=20
competency centers around leveraging technology to create more=20
transparent and efficient electronic markets that provide a=20
valuable service to the institutional buy-side and banks that=20
are our clients.
    Before electronic markets like Tradeweb were established in=20
fixed income, institutional clients picked up the phone and=20
spoke to different dealers to obtain prices and trade U.S.=20
Government bonds. This phone-based trading model is how the OTC=20
derivatives market largely functions today.
    In the late 1990s, due to technological advances and the=20
acceptance of the Internet, we saw an opportunity to provide=20
buy-side clients with greater pretrade price transparency and=20
execution efficiency in the U.S. Government bond market. In=20
1997, we established Tradeweb and created the first multibank=20
electronic Request for Quote marketplace for U.S. Treasury=20
securities. Our RFQ model gave clients the ability to run an=20
electronic auction among banks to get the best price and=20
automate a manual trading process.
    Tradeweb&#39;s RFQ marketplace for U.S. Government bonds helped=20
transform a phone-based and largely opaque Government bond=20
market into a more transparent and competitive and efficient=20
market, with the added benefit of reducing operational risk. As=20
a result of this evolution, institutional clients such as asset=20
managers and pension funds now have access to regulated trading=20
systems that provide greater price transparency and more=20
efficient execution. Today on Tradeweb&#39;s global platform for=20
Government bonds, we trade on average approximately $40 billion=20
each day with 1,000 institutional clients located in every=20
financial center around the world. Among all of our platforms=20
and products, the daily volume on Tradeweb is in excess of $300=20
billion per day.
    Tradeweb supports the goals of Dodd-Frank, which we believe=20
to be enhanced transparency and reduction of systemic risk.=20
However, it is vitally important to understand and give due=20
consideration to the needs of market participants in=20
promulgating rules for implementing Title VII. The aim must be=20
to achieve the goals of the act without materially disrupting=20
the market and the liquidity it provides to end users.
    Market participants need confidence to participate in these=20
markets, and if careful consideration is not given to what the=20
rules say, we fear that this confidence could be materially=20
shaken.
    The key for achieving the policy objectives for SEFs is to=20
provide for flexibility in the way market participants can=20
interact and trade swaps. Creating arbitrary or artificially=20
prescriptive limitations on the manner in which market=20
participants interact and trade could result in liquidity=20
drying up, increased costs to trade swaps, and market=20
participants seeking other, less efficient ways to manage their=20
risk.
    Finally, there has been a great deal of discussion recently=20
about how best to implement the proposed rules. There is no=20
doubt that an overly hasty timetable for implementation could=20
directly impact the health of the derivatives market, given the=20
complexity of the system. Implementing these regulations in one=20
big bang is unrealistic, so phasing in the rules is a very=20
sensible approach.
    However, market participants need clear guidance on when=20
the rules will be effective. This is particularly true for=20
firms such as Tradeweb that commit capital to build technology=20
to support these markets. We believe it is very important for=20
the SEC and CFTC to set clear time frames for when rules will=20
be effective as soon as practical, and we commend Chairman=20
Gensler for taking the initiative to discuss this in an open=20
forum in early May and take public comment on the time frames.
    Furthermore, any difference in rules between the SEC and=20
CFTC should be largely eliminated. If there are material=20
differences between the two regulators&#39; rules, the costs for=20
compliance and building technology will go up considerably. By=20
ensuring that the SEC and the CFTC rules retain sufficient=20
flexibility for market participants, clients can trade in a=20
manner that suits their trading strategies and risk profiles.=20
Some institutions may want to transact on live prices. Others=20
may want to use a disclosed RFQ model. And still others may=20
want to trade anonymously in an order book. Regulators should=20
not mandate that clients or platforms pick one model or offer=20
all models. Flexibility that allows for innovation among=20
technology providers is critical to attract the capital=20
necessary to fund the investments in these technologies.
    In conclusion, we support the goals to reform the=20
derivatives market, and indeed we provide the very solutions=20
the regulation seeks to achieve. But we are concerned that the=20
Commissions may be overly prescriptive and, in doing so, create=20
unintended consequences for market participants and the=20
marketplace as a whole. We hope our experience in the=20
electronic markets can be helpful and instructive as Congress=20
and the regulators take on the great challenge of implementing=20
Title VII of Dodd-Frank.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Olesky.
    Mr. Duffy, please proceed.

 STATEMENT OF TERRENCE A. DUFFY, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, CME GROUP=20
                              INC.

    Mr. Duffy. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, Members=20
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on=20
the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and=20
Consumer Protection Act. I am Terry Duffy, Executive Chairman=20
of CME Group, which includes our clearinghouse and four=20
exchanges, CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX.
    In 2000, Congress adopted the Commodity Futures=20
Modernization Act. This leveled the playing field with our=20
foreign competitors and permitted us to recapture our position=20
as the world&#39;s most innovative and successful regulated=20
exchange and clearinghouse. As a result, we remain an engine of=20
economic growth in Chicago, New York, and the Nation.
    In 2008, the financial crisis focused attention on over-
leveraged, under-regulated banks and financial firms. In=20
contrast, regulated futures markets and futures clearinghouses=20
operated flawlessly before, during, and after the crisis.=20
Congress responded to the financial crisis by reining in the=20
OTC market, to reduce systemic risk through central clearing=20
and exchange trading of derivatives, to increase data=20
transparency and price discovery, and to prevent fraud and=20
market manipulation. We support these goals.
    But we are concerned that the CFTC has launched an=20
initiative to undo modern regulation of futures exchanges and=20
clearinghouses. We are not alone. Most careful observers and=20
some Commissioners have concluded that many of the proposed=20
regulations roll back principle-based regulation and=20
unnecessarily expand the Commission&#39;s mandate. The CFTC is=20
attempting to change its role. It is an oversight agency whose=20
purpose has been to assure compliance with sound principles.=20
Now, it appears as if it is trying to become a frontline=20
decision maker, empowered to impose its business judgments on=20
every operational aspect of derivatives trading and clearing.
    This role reversal is inconsistent with Dodd-Frank. It will=20
require doubling of the Commission&#39;s staff and budget. It will=20
impose astronomical costs on the industry and the end users of=20
derivatives. My written testimony includes numerous examples of=20
rulemaking that will have costly adverse consequences on=20
customers, intermediaries, exchanges, and the economy.=20
Obviously, the increased cost will have an indirect impact on=20
business and employment in the</pre></div></div></blockquote></div></div></=
