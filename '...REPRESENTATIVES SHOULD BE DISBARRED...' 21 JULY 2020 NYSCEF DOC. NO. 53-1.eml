been filed on behalf of MYSELF BY OTHERS.

                     [2022.04.17 [Price Waterhouse 
Cooper][SEC][Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002].pdf]

     CURRENTLY PRESENTS AN EVEN LARGER BODY OF RISK WHICH WAS DUE TO THE 
OMISSION, AND FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
BY THE ZUCKER ORGANIZATION AND ITS COUNSELORS WHO WILL ACCEPT $2.00 AND 
ALSO WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS ASKED WILL PAY TO AVOID TO THEIR OWN 
PROSECUTION AS SEEN IN THE HARASSMENT OF THE COURTS WITHOUT ANY 
"REASONABLE CAUSE".

     FILER 1516523, and with a BRAND NEW SET OF KEYS-
     ENJOY THESE COURT DOCKETS WHILE YOU CROSS THEM AS WELL.... AFTER 
THEY JUST DETONATED THEIR PRIOR INVESTMENT ADVISER, ALL OF THEIR 
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS HOWEVER AT THE EXPENSE OF AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN 
$900,000,000.00 IN THE PROCESS (AS OF CURRENT) SEEN IN THE LOSSES BY ITS 
INVESTORS.

     to avoid THIS: 
https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker/tx-state-farm-lloyds

     MAINTAIN THE SAME SUB-MANAGER, COMPLIANCE OFFICER, ADDRESS - AND 
PAID 912,500.00 TO CONDUCT THAT SMOOTH MANEUVER.

     - ALL WHILE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES, DID NOT WORK OUT IN THE 
INTEREST OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR INVESTORS.


     --- IS GROSS NEGLIGENCE - BY DEFINITION TO PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS - 
AND PROXY EVERYONE FOR:

     $   9000.00 OF ACCOUNTING,
     $ 170000.00 IN POSTAGE,
     $ 443000.00 IN DIRECTORS FEES, ETC. FOR A TOTAL COST OF 912,500.00

-- WILL PAY TO AVOID THE VIOLATION ABOVE --- BUT WON'T FILE AT ANY COST 
("WHICH IS FREE") TO KEEP THEIR INVESTORS INFORMED.


INSTEAD:    FILE THEMSELVES DOWN TO ZERO "UNCOVERED" AND without any 
material DISCLOSURE OF A LEGAL MATTER LOAN and without EXPLANATION or a 
FINE REGISTERED so the subscribers at $250.00 (two hundred and fifty 
dollar allotments) can make an INFORMED DECISION - is pathetic.

THEIR "REQUEST FOR JUDICIARY INTERVENTION" WHICH WAS ADDRESSED TO MYSELF

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, 
including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State 
Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal 
Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, 
hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 
2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 
2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, 
the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial 
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the 
results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the 
changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of 
the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial 
statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included 
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

     November 22, 2021
     We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies 
in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

Hey Josephine good evening,

I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Gorman received NOTICE earlier, and 
so I filed these two CRD reports to make sure that her was alerted to 
this effect. I later sent it to institutional sales that I found on the 
Bloomberg Terminal, also to the attorneys as referenced below in a 
Material Filing which carries several problems as referenced in the 
language of the EX-99.CERT and EX-99.906CERT.

BELOW MY SIGNATURE ARE THE DOCUMENTS I USED TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS MADE 
AWARE OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND TO AVOID ANY FURTHER LOSSES.

- even when I confirm the receipt of my files in the Pryor

     - and obtain those confirmations of filings which have been overlooked.

- but again... for those who absolutely DO NOT WANT ME TO FILE, or don't 
like that I file

     - I already FILED.
--- PLUS ALSO, I would like to inform you... that I also don't want to 
file as well.
OTHER THAN when I do FILE something that FILE-hater doesn't like.

also... for those who also get OBSTRUCTED, or HARASSED by the STATE FARM 
OF ZUCKER FOR YEARS...

- make sure you use the words FILE, and FILE time and time again--- 
because THEY HATE on files, like PHd.
--- and quite frankly. i am also a hater of file-haters and I have been 
hating all day

- but mostly because I read about a stage-4 situation. as, timing IS 
ALSO CRITICAL...
--- quicker than RICKY HENDERSON like the 24TH of November, and after 
that as well, also earlier...
filed in NY SUPREME MATTER 153974/2020 - was FILED... OBSTRUCTED, AND 
EGREGIOUSLY.

so file away Miss Daugherty! and also use the word ANNEX as frequently 
as possible...
--- only because State Farm hates that word, and I


this for example, is also fantastic when people HATE on confirmations...

       WHICH have been filed, and also delivered

and ADDITIONALLY well received.

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, 
including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State 
Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal 
Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, 
hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 
2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 
2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, 
the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial 
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the 
results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the 
changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 
through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period 
ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of 
the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial 
statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included 
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

     We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies 
in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

STATE FARM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 3487



Opinions on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying 
statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of 
investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State 
Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds 
constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred 
to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of 
operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 
and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net 
assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and 
for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, 
including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of 
the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the 
“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each 
of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their 
operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 
and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net 
assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and 
for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each 
of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Basis for Opinions***These financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our 
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We 
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those 
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our 
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures 
included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

I ALSO PROVIDED TO MISS DOUGHERTY & HER COUNSELORS AS WELL..
- SO LET ME KNOW IF THOSE CRDs ARE NOT REFLECTING THE DOCKET, AND LOSSES 
FOR THE $9000.00 AUDIT AS WELL FOR $170,000.00 PAID IN POSTAGE.

1.    “UNREGISTERED SECURITY” and a 'FIDELITY' of State Farm Assurances 
Funds Trust, under its Principals is ANNEXED in NYSCEF Matter 
153974/2020, as is the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust but is not 
disclosed under B.14 had been omitted in the new IA, ADVISERS INVESTMENT 
TRUST as well.
2.    Omissions held at the new Investment Adviser are tucked from the 
public eye, absent of their Promoters in the earlier fund, which DECIDED 
TO NO LONGER EXIST.
3.    The premiums and interest paid by the Sullivan Properties LP to 
State Farm are unreasonable with respect to the properties they 
guarantee, as the Tax payments are an assurance in the Loan I annexed in 
the matter of 153974/2020 which was in a NY Supreme Court so we have a 
failure by all members of State Farm VP Management Corp, who executed 
and Notarized the Loan 50074.
5.    OBSTRUCTION.       I requested to amend the CAPTION to include all 
material parties, notwithstanding the ENTITY in the scope of this Loan 
50074, having NOT indemnified themselves in the event of an issue of 
insolvency; where reimbursement would be impossible.
6.    INVESTOR RISK EXPOSURE.      10-years of erroneous reports and 
linear growth in income generated an automatic PROPERTY VALUE ASSESSMENT 
[NOPV] by the NY Dept. of Taxation, which was paid quarterly and for the 
last-15 years. The penalties, compounded interest, and for 10-YEARS is 
approximately $50,000,000.00; and was calculated on the basis of the 
property taxes reported and paid as promulgated by the NY Dept of 
Finance and Taxation, is so not authorized to conduct investment banking 
transactions or structure Loans for clients in the State of New York 
(Harbert) who is affiliated and as a director of State Farm Lloyds and 
the State Farm Assurances Trust.
7.    CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.         EVASION with INTENT is understood as 
seen in the proceedings and NY tax records for all properties, which 
have reported YoY double digit gains in the estimates and also the 
receipts for the buildings to obtain a $6,000,000.00 (six million dollar 
loan) collateralized by those assets and guaranteed in letter of credit 
from State Farm, issued those monies to the SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP and 
the NOTE 50074 was secured by the unlawful fees, rents, and leases which 
are not permitted to be held at a US depository, per the FDIC, without a 
certificate of occupancy - present an indeterminate risk and liability 
to its investors without any DISCLOSURE by any Member of State Farm VP 
Management Corp (FINRA MEMBER 43036) and its PROMOTERS (MS), as 
contemporaneous notice of the TCR filed on November 13th, 2021 was also 
provided to MS on November 16th, 2021; and again on December 18th, 2021 
as their “Promoters of consistent and correct information…” received 
premiums and without any public records which demonstrate any 
responsibility as their fiduciary roles to both the investors and risks 
as seen in the losses observed in the losses by the four tickers now 
under the management of ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST.
      As far as the opportunity cost for the investors who blindly 
invested their assets into the surviving IA, could have placed the money 
into a safer and similar holding company like ticker: BRK-B, without 
having to take advantage of the underlying information and holdings 
which are reported by Mr. Monk and without and Level 3 exposure, who 
works with Mr.Harbert at STATE FARM VP MANAGEMENT CORP as its Principal 
at the State Farm Assurances Trusts In the prior.
       Bonds, Stocks, and other derivatives more likely than not were 
used to their advantage in addition to the premiums received by MORGAN 
STANLEY, and at the sacrifice of certain obligations to the State Farm 
Assurances Funds Trust also obtained payments to “better promote the 
quality of information…” and without consideration of the implications 
to aiding and abetting to the taxes avoided by the Sullivan Properties 
LP, as referenced hereunder, which also poses a huge threat to the 
current investors of ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST, do not report this in 
their public filings, and by their new Compliance Officer 'LUDWIG' from 
the prior is licensed with State Farm VP management Corp as its Chief 
compliance Officer.
        11-30-2021 Annual Report reported 'LUDWIG' 'Monk' and later 
Nasdaq for the closing prices ending on 03-31-2022 under the new Adviser 
is also “Not Covered” for the Omission and losses registered, whereby 
the Compliance officer has not DISCLOSED the Loan, legal proceedings, 
and compensated the C.16 Brokers — despite having knowledge of Loan 
50074 in the matter of New York Supreme 153974/2020.
      I discovered and annexed upon discovery of no Certificate of 
Occupancy those risks in June of 2020 and for several buildings owned 
and operated by the recipient of the cash for Loan 50074, which was 
credited by State Farm, and located at one State Farm Plaza was also 
Notarized by its FIDELITY under the blanket of the SFITX 40-17G indenture.
8.   CUSTODY RISK.      JP Morgan has stepped aside as its custodian, 
however the Loan 50074 has caused a certain loss and at the cost of 
$912,500.00, it was decided that a merge me into a larger body of risk; 
despite having doubled their limit of their AUDIT expense… are not 
covered for the Omissions and by their own indenture for the losses 
suffered for a failure to DISCLOSE the legal proceedings, Loan, have 
DISCLOSED the Directors as “Covered” for Omissions after having absorbed 
nearly $900,000,000.00 (nine hundred million dollars) in losses and in 
the first quarter of 2022.
The last and final report by the CIK 931715 in 11-30-2021 as ASSETS 
transferred to the new Adviser [151…] lost these monies as accounted for 
each ticker and using the link below.
9.    AUDIT FEES.      Under the indenture and limit of liability in the 
prior, we’re “Not Covered” hence paid $9,000.00 I’m accounting with 
Price Waterhouse as their sole accounting firm, however did check off a 
box to set aside certain expenses for the future and in the new 
umbrella, which was increased from $25,000 to $50,000 however is not 
covered given the total assets under management which accepts a minimum 
investments at $250.00 and in $50.00 increments, and paid $170,000.00 in 
postage to main those “proxies” and during the interim period of 
“Merger” the Directors of State Farm VP Management Corp also paid 
themselves roughly $400,000.00 in “Director Fees”.
10.    UNFAIR DEALINGS.      Morgan Stanley accounted YoY payments in 
FY2020, FY2021, and in 2020 accounted a partial payment for the interim 
period and in their fiduciary roles permitted for other to enjoin 
without any notice of disclosure both to the other “Brokers” under C.16 
and to the investors who suffered losses at the GROSS NEGLIGENCE also 
may have also taken advantage of the imminent losses, with prior 
knowledge of the material and substance of the Loan, pending legal 
action, continued to further aid and abet to the above matters and also 
were paid to bring more investors into the New Adviser.

          support.<br>
          Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a provision of
          financial support includes any (1) capital contribution, (2)
          purchase of a security from a Money Market Fund in reliance on
          rule 17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), (3) purchase of
          any defaulted or devalued security at fair value reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio, (4) execution of letter of credit
          or letter of indemnity, (5) capital support agreement (whether
          or not the Registrant ultimately received support), (6)
          performance guarantee, or (7) other similar action reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio. Provision of financial support
          does not include any (1) routine waiver of fees or
          reimbursement of Registrant's expenses, (2) routine inter-fund
          lending, (3) routine inter-fund purchases of Registrant's
          shares, or (4) action that would qualify as financial support
          as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise
          determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or
          stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's
          portfolio.<br>

          Opinions on the Financial Statements<br>
          <br>
          We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
          liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State
          Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim
          Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds
          constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively
          referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the
          related statements of operations for the period December 1,
          2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November
          30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for
          each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020,
          including the related notes, and the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred
          to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the
          financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
          the financial position of each of the Funds as of September
          30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the
          year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net
          assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30,
          2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended
          November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with
          accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
          of America.<br>
          <br>
          Basis for Opinions<br>
          <br>
          These financial statements are the responsibility of the
          Funds’ management.<br>
          Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’
          financial statements based on our audits.<br>
          We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
          Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
          are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in
          accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
          applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.<br>
          We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
          accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
          require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
          reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
          are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
          fraud.    <br>
          Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
          of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
          due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
          to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
          basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
          financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
          accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
          management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
          the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation
          of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
          with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received
          from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We
          believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
          opinions.<br>

          Item B.14. Provision of financial support.<br>
          Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a provision of
          financial support includes any (1) capital contribution, (2)
          purchase of a security from a Money Market Fund in reliance on
          rule 17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), (3) purchase of
          any defaulted or devalued security at fair value reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio, (4) execution of letter of credit
          or letter of indemnity, (5) capital support agreement (whether
          or not the Registrant ultimately received support), (6)
          performance guarantee, or (7) other similar action reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio. Provision of financial support
          does not include any (1) routine waiver of fees or
          reimbursement of Registrant's expenses, (2) routine inter-fund
          lending, (3) routine inter-fund purchases of Registrant's
          shares, or (4) action that would qualify as financial support
          as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise
          determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or
          stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's
          portfolio.<br>

          Hey Josephine good evening,<br>
          <br>
          I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Gorman received NOTICE
          earlier, and so I filed these two CRD reports to make sure
          that her was alerted to this effect. I later sent it to
          institutional sales that I found on the Bloomberg Terminal,
          also to the attorneys as referenced below in a Material Filing
          which carries several problems as referenced in the language
          of the EX-99.CERT and EX-99.906CERT.<br>
          <br>
          BELOW MY SIGNATURE ARE THE DOCUMENTS I USED TO ENSURE THAT HE
          WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND TO AVOID ANY FURTHER
          LOSSES.<br>

          and after that as well, also earlier...<br>
          filed in NY SUPREME MATTER 153974/2020 - was FILED...
          OBSTRUCTED, AND EGREGIOUSLY.<br>

          so file away Miss Daugherty! and also use the word ANNEX as
          frequently as possible...<br>
          --- only because State Farm hates that word, and I<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          this for example, is also fantastic when people HATE on

          Opinions on the Financial Statements<br>
          <br>
          We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
          liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State
          Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim
          Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds
          constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively
          referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the
          related statements of operations for the period December 1,
          2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November
          30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for
          each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020,
          including the related notes, and the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred
          to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the
          financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
          the financial position of each of the Funds as of September
          30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the
          period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the
          year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net
          assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30,
          2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended
          November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for
          each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with
          accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
          of America.<br>
          <br>
          Basis for Opinions<br>
          <br>
          These financial statements are the responsibility of the
          Funds’ management.<br>
          Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’
          financial statements based on our audits.<br>
          We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
          Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
          are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in
          accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
          applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.<br>
          We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
          accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
          require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
          reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
          are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
          fraud.    <br>
          Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
          of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
          due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
          to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
          basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
          financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
          accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
          management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
          the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation
          of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
          with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received
          from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We
          believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
          opinions.<br>

          Item B.14. Provision of financial support.<br>
          Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a provision of
          financial support includes any (1) capital contribution, (2)
          purchase of a security from a Money Market Fund in reliance on
          rule 17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), (3) purchase of
          any defaulted or devalued security at fair value reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio, (4) execution of letter of credit
          or letter of indemnity, (5) capital support agreement (whether
          or not the Registrant ultimately received support), (6)
          performance guarantee, or (7) other similar action reasonably
          intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of
          the Registrant's portfolio. Provision of financial support
          does not include any (1) routine waiver of fees or
          reimbursement of Registrant's expenses, (2) routine inter-fund
          lending, (3) routine inter-fund purchases of Registrant's
          shares, or (4) action that would qualify as financial support
          as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise
          determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or
          stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's
          portfolio.<br>

          Opinions on the Financial Statements We have audited the
          accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
          the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State
          Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm
          Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers
          Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the
          “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of
          operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September
          30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements
          of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020
          through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in
          the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related
          notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
          indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial
          statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present
          fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
          each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of
          each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020
          through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30,
          2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period
          December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of
          the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each
          of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated
          therein in conformity with accounting principles generally
          accepted in the United States of America. Basis for
          Opinions***These financial statements are the responsibility
          of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an
          opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our
          audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
          Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
          (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
          Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
          the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of
          these financial statements in accordance with the standards of
          the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
          the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
          financial statements are free of material misstatement,
          whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
          procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
          financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
          performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
          procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
          regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
          principles used and significant estimates made by management,
          as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
          financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
          securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence
          with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received
          from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We
          believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
          opinions.<br>

          I ALSO PROVIDED TO MISS DOUGHERTY &amp; HER COUNSELORS AS
          WELL..<br>
          - SO LET ME KNOW IF THOSE CRDs ARE NOT REFLECTING THE DOCKET,
          AND LOSSES FOR THE $9000.00 AUDIT AS WELL FOR $170,000.00 PAID
          IN POSTAGE.<br>
          <br>
          1.    “UNREGISTERED SECURITY” and a 'FIDELITY' of State Farm
          Assurances Funds Trust, under its Principals is ANNEXED in
          NYSCEF Matter 153974/2020, as is the State Farm Assurances
          Funds Trust but is not disclosed under B.14 had been omitted
          in the new IA, ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST as well.<br>
          2.    Omissions held at the new Investment Adviser are tucked
          from the public eye, absent of their Promoters in the earlier
          fund, which DECIDED TO NO LONGER EXIST.<br>
          3.    The premiums and interest paid by the Sullivan
          Properties LP to State Farm are unreasonable with respect to
          the properties they guarantee, as the Tax payments are an
          assurance in the Loan I annexed in the matter of 153974/2020
          which was in a NY Supreme Court so we have a failure by all
          members of State Farm VP Management Corp, who executed and
          Notarized the Loan 50074.                     <br>
          5.    OBSTRUCTION.       I requested to amend the CAPTION to
          include all material parties, notwithstanding the ENTITY in
          the scope of this Loan 50074, having NOT indemnified
          themselves in the event of an issue of insolvency; where
          reimbursement would be impossible.<br>
          6.    INVESTOR RISK EXPOSURE.      10-years of erroneous
          reports and linear growth in income generated an automatic
          PROPERTY VALUE ASSESSMENT [NOPV] by the NY Dept. of Taxation,
          which was paid quarterly and for the last-15 years. The
          penalties, compounded interest, and for 10-YEARS is
          approximately $50,000,000.00; and was calculated on the basis
          of the property taxes reported and paid as promulgated by the
          NY Dept of Finance and Taxation, is so not authorized to
          conduct investment banking transactions or structure Loans for
          clients in the State of New York (Harbert) who is affiliated
          and as a director of State Farm Lloyds and the State Farm
          Assurances Trust.<br>
          7.    CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.         EVASION with INTENT is
          understood as seen in the proceedings and NY tax records for
          all properties, which have reported YoY double digit gains in
          the estimates and also the receipts for the buildings to
          obtain a $6,000,000.00 (six million dollar loan)
          collateralized by those assets and guaranteed in letter of
          credit from State Farm, issued those monies to the SULLIVAN
          PROPERTIES LP and the NOTE 50074 was secured by the unlawful
          fees, rents, and leases which are not permitted to be held at
          a US depository, per the FDIC, without a certificate of
          occupancy - present an indeterminate risk and liability to its
          investors without any DISCLOSURE by any Member of State Farm
          VP Management Corp (FINRA MEMBER 43036) and its PROMOTERS
          (MS), as contemporaneous notice of the TCR filed on November
          13th, 2021 was also provided to MS on November 16th, 2021; and
          again on December 18th, 2021 as their “Promoters of consistent
          and correct information…” received premiums and without any
          public records which demonstrate any responsibility as their
          fiduciary roles to both the investors and risks as seen in the
          losses observed in the losses by the four tickers now under
          the management of ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST.<br>
               As far as the opportunity cost for the investors who
          blindly invested their assets into the surviving IA, could
          have placed the money into a safer and similar holding company
          like ticker: BRK-B, without having to take advantage of the
          underlying information and holdings which are reported by Mr.
          Monk and without and Level 3 exposure, who works with
          Mr.Harbert at STATE FARM VP MANAGEMENT CORP as its Principal
          at the State Farm Assurances Trusts In the prior.<br>
                Bonds, Stocks, and other derivatives more likely than
          not were used to their advantage in addition to the premiums
          received by MORGAN STANLEY, and at the sacrifice of certain
          obligations to the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust also
          obtained payments to “better promote the quality of
          information…” and without consideration of the implications to
          aiding and abetting to the taxes avoided by the Sullivan
          Properties LP, as referenced hereunder, which also poses a
          huge threat to the current investors of ADVISERS INVESTMENT
          TRUST, do not report this in their public filings, and by
          their new Compliance Officer 'LUDWIG' from the prior is
          licensed with State Farm VP management Corp as its Chief
          compliance Officer.<br>
                 11-30-2021 Annual Report reported 'LUDWIG' 'Monk' and
          later Nasdaq for the closing prices ending on 03-31-2022 under
          the new Adviser is also “Not Covered” for the Omission and
          losses registered, whereby the Compliance officer has not
          DISCLOSED the Loan, legal proceedings, and compensated the
          C.16 Brokers — despite having knowledge of Loan 50074 in the
          matter of New York Supreme 153974/2020.<br>
               I discovered and annexed upon discovery of no Certificate
          of Occupancy those risks in June of 2020 and for several
          buildings owned and operated by the recipient of the cash for
          Loan 50074, which was credited by State Farm, and located at
          one State Farm Plaza was also Notarized by its FIDELITY under
          the blanket of the SFITX 40-17G indenture.<br>
          8.   CUSTODY RISK.      JP Morgan has stepped aside as its
          custodian, however the Loan 50074 has caused a certain loss
          and at the cost of $912,500.00, it was decided that a merge me
          into a larger body of risk; despite having doubled their limit
          of their AUDIT expense… are not covered for the Omissions and
          by their own indenture for the losses suffered for a failure
          to DISCLOSE the legal proceedings, Loan, have DISCLOSED the
          Directors as “Covered” for Omissions after having absorbed
          nearly $900,000,000.00 (nine hundred million dollars) in
          losses and in the first quarter of 2022.<br>
          The last and final report by the CIK 931715 in 11-30-2021 as
          ASSETS transferred to the new Adviser [151…] lost these monies
          as accounted for each ticker and using the link below.<br>
          9.    AUDIT FEES.      Under the indenture and limit of
          liability in the prior, we’re “Not Covered” hence paid
          $9,000.00 I’m accounting with Price Waterhouse as their sole
          accounting firm, however did check off a box to set aside
          certain expenses for the future and in the new umbrella, which
          was increased from $25,000 to $50,000 however is not covered
          given the total assets under management which accepts a
          minimum investments at $250.00 and in $50.00 increments, and
          paid $170,000.00 in postage to main those “proxies” and during
          the interim period of “Merger” the Directors of State Farm VP
          Management Corp also paid themselves roughly $400,000.00 in
          “Director Fees”.<br>
